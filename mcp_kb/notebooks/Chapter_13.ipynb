    "Imagine a beach populated with sunbathers and swimmers. As those basking in the sun get too hot, they enter the surf to swim and cool off. As the swimmers tire, they return to the beach to rest. If the rate at which sunbathers enter the surf were to equal the rate at which swimmers return to the sand, then the numbers (though not the identities) of sunbathers and swimmers would remain constant. This scenario illustrates a dynamic phenomenon known as equilibrium, in which opposing processes occur at equal rates. Chemical and physical processes are subject to this phenomenon; these processes are at equilibrium when the forward and reverse reaction rates are equal. Equilibrium systems are pervasive in nature; the various reactions involving carbon dioxide dissolved in blood are examples (see Figure 13.1). This chapter provides a thorough introduction to the essential aspects of chemical equilibria.\n",

    "The convention for writing chemical equations involves placing reactant formulas on the left side of a reaction arrow and product formulas on the right side. By this convention, and the definitions of \"reactant\" and \"product,\" a chemical equation represents the reaction in question as proceeding from left to right. Reversible reactions, however, may proceed in both forward (left to right) and reverse (right to left) directions. When the rates of the forward and reverse reactions are equal, the concentrations of the reactant and product species remain constant over time and the system is at equilibrium. The relative concentrations of reactants and products in equilibrium systems vary greatly; some systems contain mostly products at equilibrium, some contain mostly reactants, and some contain appreciable amounts of both.\n",

As time passes, $\\mathrm{N}_{-2} \\mathrm{O}_{4}$ is consumed and its concentration falls, while $\\mathrm{NO}_{2}$ is produced and its concentration increases (Figure 13.2b). The decreasing concentration of the reactant slows the forward reaction rate, and the increasing product concentration speeds the reverse reaction rate (Figure 13.2c). This process continues until the forward and reverse reaction rates\n",

    "become equal, at which time the reaction has reached equilibrium, as characterized by constant concentrations of its reactants and products (shaded areas of Figure 13.2b and Figure 13.2c).

This dynamic nature is essential to understanding equilibrium behavior as discussed in this and subsequent chapters of the text.\n",

If an equilibrium system is subjected to a change in conditions that affects these reaction rates differently (a stress), then the rates are no longer equal and the system is not at equilibrium. The system will subsequently experience a net reaction in the direction of greater rate (a shift) that will re-establish the equilibrium.

Despite these differences in composition, the value of the equilibrium constant will be the same after the stress as it was before (per the law of mass action).

    "These results illustrate the relationship between the stoichiometry of a gas-phase equilibrium and the effect of a volume-induced pressure (concentration) change. If the total molar amounts of reactants and products are equal, as in the first example, a change in volume does not shift the equilibrium. If the molar amounts of reactants and products are different, a change in volume will shift the equilibrium in a direction that better \"accommodates\" the volume change. In the second example, two moles of reactant $\\left(\\mathrm{NO}_{2}\\right)$ yield three moles of product $\\left(2 \\mathrm{NO}+\\mathrm{O}_{2}\\right)$, and so decreasing the system volume causes the equilibrium to shift left since the reverse reaction produces less gas ( 2 mol ) than the forward reaction ( 3 mol ). Conversely, increasing the volume of this equilibrium system would result in a shift towards products.\n",

    "The connection between chemistry and carbonated soft drinks goes back to 1767, when Joseph Priestley (1733-1804) developed a method of infusing water with carbon dioxide to make carbonated water. Priestly's approach involved production of carbon dioxidey reacting oil of vitriol (sulfuric acid) with chalk (calcium carbonate).\n",

    "These same equilibrium reactions are the basis of today's soft-drink carbonation process. Beverages are exposed to a high pressure of gaseous carbon dioxide during the process to shift the first equilibrium above to the right, resulting in desirably high concentrations of dissolved carbon dioxide and, per similar shifts in the other two equilibria, its hydrolysis and ionization products. A bottle or can is then nearly filled with the carbonated beverage, leaving a relatively small volume of air in the container above the beverage surface (the headspace) before it is sealed. The pressure of carbon dioxide in the container headspace is very low immediately after sealing, but it rises as the dissolution equilibrium is re-established by shifting to the left. Since the volume of the beverage is significantly greater than the volume of the headspace, only a relatively small amount of dissolved carbon dioxide is lost to the headspace.\n",
    "When a carbonated beverage container is opened, a hissing sound is heard as pressurized $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ escapes from the headspace. This causes the dissolution equilibrium to shift left, resulting in a decrease in the concentration of dissolved $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and subsequent left-shifts of the hydrolysis and ionization equilibria. Fortunately for the consumer, the dissolution equilibrium is usually re-established slowly, and so the beverage may be enjoyed while its dissolved carbon dioxide concentration remains palatably high. Once the equilibria are re-established, the $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}(a q)$ concentration will be significantly lowered, and the beverage acquires a characteristic taste referred to as \"flat.\"\n",

Since the rate constants vary with temperature as described by the Arrhenius equation, is stands to reason that the equilibrium constant will likewise vary with temperature (assuming the rate constants are affected to different extents by the temperature change). For more complex reactions involving multistep reaction mechanisms, a similar but more complex mathematical relation exists between the equilibrium constant and the rate constants of the steps in the mechanism. Regardless of how complex the reaction may be, the temperature-dependence of its equilibrium constant persists.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 13.1 Chemical Equilibria\n",
    "\n",
    "A reversible reaction is at equilibrium when the forward and reverse processes occur at equal rates. Chemical equilibria are dynamic processes characterized by constant amounts of reactant and product species.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 13.2 Equilibrium Constants\n",
    "\n",
    "The composition of a reaction mixture may be represented by a mathematical function known as the reaction quotient, Q. For a reaction at equilibrium, the composition is constant, and $Q$ is called the equilibrium constant, $K$.\n",
    "\n",
    "A homogeneous equilibrium is an equilibrium in which all components are in the same phase. A heterogeneous equilibrium is an equilibrium in which components are in two or more phases.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 13.3 Shifting Equilibria: Le Ch√¢telier's Principle\n",
    "\n",
    "Systems at equilibrium can be disturbed by changes to temperature, concentration, and, in some cases, volume and pressure. The system's response to these disturbances is described by Le Ch√¢telier's principle: An equilibrium system subjected to a disturbance will shift in a way that counters the disturbance and re-establishes equilibrium. A catalyst will increase the rate of both the forward and reverse reactions of a reversible process, increasing the rate at which\n",
    "\n",
    "equilibrium is reached but not altering the equilibrium mixture's composition ( $K$ does not change).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 13.4 Equilibrium Calculations \n",
    "\n",
    "Calculating values for equilibrium constants and/or equilibrium concentrations is of practical benefit to many applications. A mathematical strategy that uses initial concentrations, changes in concentrations, and equilibrium concentrations (and goes by the acronym ICE) is useful for several types of equilibrium calculations.\n",
