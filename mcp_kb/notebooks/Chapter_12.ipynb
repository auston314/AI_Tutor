    "The lizard in the photograph is not simply enjoying the sunshine or working on its tan. The heat from the sun's rays is critical to the lizard's survival. A warm lizard can move faster than a cold one because the chemical reactions that allow its muscles to move occur more rapidly at higher temperatures. A cold lizard is a slower lizard and an easier meal for predators.\n",

    "From baking a cake to determining the useful lifespan of a bridge, rates of chemical reactions play important roles in our understanding of processes that involve chemical changes. Two questions are typically posed when planning to carry out a chemical reaction. The first is: \"Will the reaction produce the desired products in useful quantities?\" The second question is: \"How rapidly will the reaction occur?\" A third question is often asked when investigating reactions in greater detail: \"What specific molecular-level processes take place as the reaction occurs?\" Knowing the answer to this question is of practical importance when the yield or rate of a reaction needs to be controlled.\n",
    "\n",
    "The study of chemical kinetics concerns the second and third questions-that is, the rate at which a reaction yields products and the molecular-scale means by which a reaction occurs. This chapter examines the factors that influence the rates of chemical reactions, the mechanisms by which reactions proceed, and the quantitative techniques used to\n",

    "\n",
    "By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Define chemical reaction rate\n",

    "- Calculate reaction rates from experimental data\n",
    "\n",
    "A rate is a measure of how some property varies with time. Speed is a familiar rate that expresses the distance traveled by an object in a given amount of time. Wage is a rate that represents the amount of money earned by a person working for a given amount of time. Likewise, the rate of a chemical reaction is a measure of how much reactant is consumed, or how much product is produced, by the reaction in a given amount of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rate of reaction is the change in the amount of a reactant or product per unit time. Reaction rates are therefore determined by measuring the time dependence of some property that can be related to reactant or product amounts. Rates of reactions that consume or produce gaseous substances, for example, are conveniently determined by measuring changes in volume or pressure. For reactions involving one or more colored substances, rates may be monitored via measurements of light absorption. For reactions involving aqueous electrolytes, rates may be measured via changes in a solution's conductivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "For reactants and products in solution, their relative amounts (concentrations) are conveniently used for purposes of expressing reaction rates. For example, the concentration of hydrogen peroxide, $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{2}$, in an aqueous solution changes slowly over time as it decomposes according to the equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "2 \\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{2}(a q) \\longrightarrow 2 \\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}(l)+\\mathrm{O}_{2}(g)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The rate at which the hydrogen peroxide decomposes can be expressed in terms of the rate of change of its concentration, as shown here:\n",
    "\n",

    "This mathematical representation of the change in species concentration over time is the rate expression for the reaction. The brackets indicate molar concentrations, and the symbol delta ( $\\Delta$ ) indicates \"change in.\" Thus, $\\left[\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{2}\\right]_{t_{1}}$ represents the molar concentration of hydrogen peroxide at some time $t_{1}$; likewise, $\\left[\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{2}\\right]_{t_{2}}$ represents the molar concentration of hydrogen peroxide at a later time $t_{2}$; and $\\Delta\\left[\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{2}\\right]$ represents the change in molar concentration of hydrogen peroxide during the time interval $\\Delta t$ (that is, $t_{2}-t_{1}$ ). Since the reactant concentration decreases as the reaction proceeds, $\\Delta\\left[\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{2}\\right]$ is a negative quantity. Reaction rates are, by convention, positive quantities, and so this negative change in concentration is multiplied by -1 .

    "This behavior indicates the reaction continually slows with time. Using the concentrations at the beginning and end of a time period over which the reaction rate is changing results in the calculation of an average rate for the reaction over this time interval. At any specific time, the rate at which a reaction is proceeding is known as its instantaneous rate. The instantaneous rate of a reaction at \"time zero,\" when the reaction commences, is its initial rate. Consider the analogy of a car slowing down as it approaches a stop sign. The vehicle's initial rate-analogous to the beginning of a chemical reaction-would be the speedometer reading at the moment the driver begins pressing the brakes $\\left(t_{0}\\right)$. A few moments later, the instantaneous rate at a specific moment-call it $t_{1}$ â€”would be somewhat slower, as indicated by the speedometer reading at that point in time. As time passes, the instantaneous rate will continue to fall until it reaches zero, when the car (or reaction) stops. Unlike instantaneous speed, the car's average speed is not indicated by the speedometer; but it can be calculated as the ratio of the distance traveled to the time required to bring the vehicle to a complete stop $(\\Delta t)$. Like the decelerating car, the average rate of a chemical reaction will fall somewhere between its initial and final rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The instantaneous rate of a reaction may be determined one of two ways. If experimental conditions permit the measurement of concentration changes over very short time intervals, then average rates computed as described earlier provide reasonably good approximations of instantaneous rates. Alternatively, a graphical procedure may be used that, in effect, yields the results that would be obtained if short time interval measurements were possible. In a plot of the concentration of hydrogen peroxide against time, the instantaneous rate of decomposition of $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{2}$ at any time $t$ is given by the slope of a straight line that is tangent to the curve at that time (Figure 12.3). These tangent line slopes may be evaluated using calculus, but the procedure for doing so is beyond the scope of this chapter.\n",

These test strips contain various chemical reagents, embedded in small pads at various locations along the strip, which undergo changes in color upon exposure to sufficient concentrations of specific substances. The usage instructions for test strips often stress that proper read time is critical for optimal results. This emphasis on read time suggests that kinetic aspects of the chemical reactions occurring on the test strip are important considerations.\n",

    "The two test reactions shown above are inherently very slow, but their rates are increased by special enzymes embedded in the test strip pad. This is an example of catalysis, a topic discussed later in this chapter. A typical glucose test strip for use with urine requires approximately 30 seconds for completion of the color-forming reactions. Reading the result too soon might lead one to conclude that the glucose concentration of the urine sample is lower than it actually is (a false-negative result). Waiting too long to assess the color change can lead to a false positive due to the slower (not catalyzed) oxidation of iodide ion by other substances found in urine.\n",

    "By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Describe the effects of chemical nature, physical state, temperature, concentration, and catalysis on reaction rates\n",
    "\n",
    "The rates at which reactants are consumed and products are formed during chemical reactions vary greatly. Five factors typically affecting the rates of chemical reactions will be explored in this section: the chemical nature of\n",
    "\n",
    "the reacting substances, the state of subdivision (one large lump versus many small particles) of the reactants, the temperature of the reactants, the concentration of the reactants, and the presence of a catalyst.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Chemical Nature of the Reacting Substances \n",
    "\n",
    "The rate of a reaction depends on the nature of the participating substances. Reactions that appear similar may have different rates under the same conditions, depending on the identity of the reactants. For example, when small pieces of the metals iron and sodium are exposed to air, the sodium reacts completely with air overnight, whereas the iron is barely affected. The active metals calcium and sodium both react with water to form hydrogen gas and a base. Yet calcium reacts at a moderate rate, whereas sodium reacts so rapidly that the reaction is almost explosive.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Physical States of the Reactants\n",
    "\n",
    "A chemical reaction between two or more substances requires intimate contact between the reactants. When reactants are in different physical states, or phases (solid, liquid, gaseous, dissolved), the reaction takes place only at the interface between the phases. Consider the heterogeneous reaction between a solid phase and either a liquid or gaseous phase. Compared with the reaction rate for large solid particles, the rate for smaller particles will be greater because the surface area in contact with the other reactant phase is greater. For example, large pieces of iron react more slowly with acids than they do with finely divided iron powder (Figure 12.6). Large pieces of wood smolder, smaller pieces burn rapidly, and saw dust burns explosively.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Temperature of the Reactants\n",
    "\n",
    "Chemical reactions typically occur faster at higher temperatures. Food can spoil quickly when left on the kitchen counter. However, the lower temperature inside of a refrigerator slows that process so that the same food remains fresh for days. Gas burners, hot plates, and ovens are often used in the laboratory to increase the speed of reactions that proceed slowly at ordinary temperatures. For many chemical processes, reaction rates are approximately doubled when the temperature is raised by $10^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Concentrations of the Reactants \n",

    "The rates of many reactions depend on the concentrations of the reactants. Rates usually increase when the concentration of one or more of the reactants increases. For example, calcium carbonate $\\left(\\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}\\right)$ deteriorates as a result of its reaction with the pollutant sulfur dioxide. The rate of this reaction depends on the amount of sulfur dioxide in the air (Figure 12.7).

This dramatic difference is caused by the presence of substances within the wound's exposed tissues that accelerate the decomposition process.

    "As described in the previous module, the rate of a reaction is often affected by the concentrations of reactants. Rate laws (sometimes called differential rate laws) or rate equations are mathematical expressions that describe the relationship between the rate of a chemical reaction and the concentration of its reactants. As an example, consider the reaction described by the chemical equation\n",

The exponents $m$ and $n$ are the reaction orders and are typically positive integers, though they can be fractions, negative, or zero. The rate constant $k$ and the reaction orders $m$ and $n$ must be determined experimentally by observing how the rate of a reaction changes as the concentrations of the reactants are changed. The rate constant $k$ is independent of the reactant concentrations, but it does vary with temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reaction orders in a rate law describe the mathematical dependence of the rate on reactant concentrations. Referring to the generic rate law above, the reaction is $m$ order with respect to $A$ and $n$ order with respect to $B$. For example, if $m=1$ and $n=2$, the reaction is first order in $A$ and second order in $B$. The overall reaction order is simply the sum of orders for each reactant. For the example rate law here, the reaction is third order overall $(1+2=$ 3). A few specific examples are shown below to further illustrate this concept.\n",

We can use an integrated rate law to determine the amount of reactant or product present after a period of time or to estimate the time required for a reaction to proceed to a certain extent. For example, an integrated rate law is used to determine the length of time a radioactive material must be stored for its radioactivity to decay to a safe level.\n",

During the second half-life (from 6.00 hours to 12.00 hours), it decreases from 0.500 M to 0.250 M ; during the third half-life, it decreases from 0.250 M to 0.125\n",

    "- Define the concepts of activation energy and transition state\n",
    "- Use the Arrhenius equation in calculations relating rate constants to temperature\n",
    "\n",
    "We should not be surprised that atoms, molecules, or ions must collide before they can react with each other. Atoms must be close together to form chemical bonds. This simple premise is the basis for a very powerful theory that explains many observations regarding chemical kinetics, including factors affecting reaction rates.\n",
    "Collision theory is based on the following postulates:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The rate of a reaction is proportional to the rate of reactant collisions:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text { reaction rate } \\propto \\frac{\\text { \\# collisions }}{\\text { time }}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The reacting species must collide in an orientation that allows contact between the atoms that will become bonded together in the product.\n",
    "3. The collision must occur with adequate energy to permit mutual penetration of the reacting species' valence shells so that the electrons can rearrange and form new bonds (and new chemical species).\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see the importance of the two physical factors noted in postulates 2 and 3, the orientation and energy of collisions, when we consider the reaction of carbon monoxide with oxygen:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "2 \\mathrm{CO}(g)+\\mathrm{O}_{2}(g) \\longrightarrow 2 \\mathrm{CO}_{2}(g)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Carbon monoxide is a pollutant produced by the combustion of hydrocarbon fuels. To reduce this pollutant, automobiles have catalytic converters that use a catalyst to carry out this reaction. It is also a side reaction of the combustion of gunpowder that results in muzzle flash for many firearms. If carbon monoxide and oxygen are present in sufficient amounts, the reaction will occur at high temperature and pressure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in the gas-phase reaction between carbon monoxide and oxygen is a collision between the two molecules:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathrm{CO}(g)+\\mathrm{O}_{2}(g) \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{CO}_{2}(g)+\\mathrm{O}(g)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Although there are many different possible orientations the two molecules can have relative to each other, consider the two presented in Figure 12.13. In the first case, the oxygen side of the carbon monoxide molecule collides with the oxygen molecule. In the second case, the carbon side of the carbon monoxide molecule collides with the oxygen molecule. The second case is clearly more likely to result in the formation of carbon dioxide, which has a central carbon atom bonded to two oxygen atoms $(\\mathrm{O}=\\mathrm{C}=\\mathrm{O})$. This is a rather simple example of how important the orientation of the collision is in terms of creating the desired product of the reaction.\n",

    "Figure 12.13 Illustrated are two collisions that might take place between carbon monoxide and oxygen molecules. The orientation of the colliding molecules partially determines whether a reaction between the two molecules will occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the collision does take place with the correct orientation, there is still no guarantee that the reaction will proceed to form carbon dioxide. In addition to a proper orientation, the collision must also occur with sufficient energy to result in product formation. When reactant species collide with both proper orientation and adequate energy, they combine to form an unstable species called an activated complex or a transition state. These species are very short lived and usually undetectable by most analytical instruments. In some cases, sophisticated spectral measurements have been used to observe transition states.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collision theory explains why most reaction rates increase as concentrations increase. With an increase in the concentration of any reacting substance, the chances for collisions between molecules are increased because there are more molecules per unit of volume. More collisions mean a faster reaction rate, assuming the energy of the collisions is adequate.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Activation Energy and the Arrhenius Equation \n",
    "\n",
    "The minimum energy necessary to form a product during a collision between reactants is called the activation energy $\\left(\\boldsymbol{E}_{\\mathrm{a}}\\right)$. How this energy compares to the kinetic energy provided by colliding reactant molecules is a primary factor affecting the rate of a chemical reaction. If the activation energy is much larger than the average kinetic energy of the molecules, the reaction will occur slowly since only a few fast-moving molecules will have enough energy to react. If the activation energy is much smaller than the average kinetic energy of the molecules, a large fraction of molecules will be adequately energetic and the reaction will proceed rapidly.\n",

    "These reaction diagrams are widely used in chemical kinetics to illustrate various properties of the reaction of interest. Viewing the diagram from left to right, the system initially comprises reactants only, $A+B$. Reactant molecules with sufficient energy can collide to form a high-energy activated complex or transition state. The unstable transition state can then subsequently decay to yield stable products, $C+D$. The diagram depicts the reaction's activation energy, $E_{a}$, as the energy difference between the reactants and the transition state. Using a specific energy, the enthalpy (see chapter on thermochemistry), the enthalpy change of the reaction, $\\Delta H$, is estimated as the energy difference between the reactants and products. In this case, the reaction is exothermic $(\\Delta H<0)$ since it yields a decrease in system enthalpy.\n",

    "\n",
    "Postulates of collision theory are nicely accommodated by the Arrhenius equation. The frequency factor, $A$, reflects how well the reaction conditions favor properly oriented collisions between reactant molecules. An increased probability of effectively oriented collisions results in larger values for $A$ and faster reaction rates.\n",
    "The exponential term, $e^{-E a / R T}$, describes the effect of activation energy on reaction rate. According to kinetic molecular theory (see chapter on gases), the temperature of matter is a measure of the average kinetic energy of its constituent atoms or molecules. The distribution of energies among the molecules composing a sample of matter at any given temperature is described by the plot shown in Figure 12.15(a). Two shaded areas under the curve represent the numbers of molecules possessing adequate energy $(R T)$ to overcome the activation barriers $\\left(E_{a}\\right)$. A lower activation energy results in a greater fraction of adequately energized molecules and a faster reaction.\n",

    "By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",

    "- Identify the molecularity of elementary reactions\n",
    "- Write a balanced chemical equation for a process given its reaction mechanism\n",
    "- Derive the rate law consistent with a given reaction mechanism\n",
    "\n",
    "Chemical reactions very often occur in a step-wise fashion, involving two or more distinct reactions taking place in sequence. A balanced equation indicates what is reacting and what is produced, but it reveals no details about how the reaction actually takes place. The reaction mechanism (or reaction path) provides details regarding the precise, step-by-step process by which a reaction occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The decomposition of ozone, for example, appears to follow a mechanism with two steps:\n",

    "While the overall reaction equation for the decomposition of ozone indicates that two molecules of ozone react to give three molecules of oxygen, the mechanism of the reaction does not involve the direct collision and reaction of two ozone molecules. Instead, one $\\mathrm{O}_{3}$ decomposes to yield $\\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and an oxygen atom, and a second $\\mathrm{O}_{3}$ molecule subsequently reacts with the oxygen atom to yield two additional $\\mathrm{O}_{2}$ molecules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike balanced equations representing an overall reaction, the equations for elementary reactions are explicit representations of the chemical change taking place. The reactant(s) in an elementary reaction's equation undergo only the bond-breaking and/or making events depicted to yield the product(s). For this reason, the rate law for an elementary reaction may be derived directly from the balanced chemical equation describing the reaction. This is not the case for typical chemical reactions, for which rate laws may be reliably determined only via experimentation.\n",

    "As described earlier, rate laws may be derived directly from the chemical equations for elementary reactions. This is not the case, however, for ordinary chemical reactions. The balanced equations most often encountered represent the overall change for some chemical system, and very often this is the result of some multistep reaction mechanisms.

The work of Molina and Rowland was instrumental in the adoption of the Montreal Protocol, an international treaty signed in 1987 that successfully began phasing out production of chemicals linked to ozone destruction.\n",

    "Enzyme molecules possess an active site, a part of the molecule with a shape that allows it to bond to a specific substrate (a reactant molecule), forming an enzyme-substrate complex as a reaction intermediate. There are two models that attempt to explain how this active site works. The most simplistic model is referred to as the lock-and-key hypothesis, which suggests that the molecular shapes of the active site and substrate are complementary, fitting together like a key in a lock. The induced fit hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests that the enzyme molecule is flexible and changes shape to accommodate a bond with the substrate. This is not to suggest that an enzyme's active site is completely malleable, however. Both the lock-and-key model and the induced fit model account for the fact that enzymes can only bind with specific substrates, since in general a particular enzyme only catalyzes a particular reaction (Figure 12.25).\n",

    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 12.1 Chemical Reaction Rates\n",
    "\n",
    "The rate of a reaction can be expressed either in terms of the decrease in the amount of a reactant or the increase in the amount of a product per unit time. Relations between different rate expressions for a given reaction are derived directly from the stoichiometric coefficients of the equation representing the reaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 12.2 Factors Affecting Reaction Rates\n",
    "\n",
    "The rate of a chemical reaction is affected by several parameters. Reactions involving two phases proceed more rapidly when there is greater surface area contact. If temperature or reactant concentration is increased, the rate of a given reaction generally increases as well. A catalyst can increase the rate of a reaction by providing an alternative pathway with a lower activation energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 12.3 Rate Laws\n",
    "\n",
    "Rate laws (differential rate laws) provide a mathematical description of how changes in the concentration of a substance affect the rate of a chemical reaction. Rate laws are determined experimentally and cannot be predicted by reaction stoichiometry. The order of reaction describes how much a change in the concentration of each substance\n",
    "\n",
    "affects the overall rate, and the overall order of a reaction is the sum of the orders for each substance present in the reaction. Reaction orders are typically first order, second order, or zero order, but fractional and even negative orders are possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 12.4 Integrated Rate Laws \n",
    "\n",
    "Integrated rate laws are mathematically derived from differential rate laws, and they describe the time dependence of reactant and product concentrations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The half-life of a reaction is the time required to decrease the amount of a given reactant by one-half. A reaction's half-life varies with rate constant and, for some reaction orders, reactant concentration. The half-life of a zero-order reaction decreases as the initial concentration of the reactant in the reaction decreases. The half-life of a first-order reaction is independent of concentration, and the half-life of a second-order reaction decreases as the concentration increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 12.5 Collision Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "Chemical reactions typically require collisions between reactant species. These reactant collisions must be of proper orientation and sufficient energy in order to result in product formation. Collision theory provides a simple but effective explanation for the effect of many experimental parameters on reaction rates. The Arrhenius equation describes the relation between a reaction's rate constant, activation energy, temperature, and dependence on collision orientation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 12.6 Reaction Mechanisms\n",
    "\n",
    "The sequence of individual steps, or elementary reactions, by which reactants are converted into products during the course of a reaction is called the reaction mechanism. The molecularity of an elementary reaction is the number of reactant species involved, typically one (unimolecular), two (bimolecular), or, less commonly, three (termolecular). The overall rate of a reaction is determined by the rate of the slowest in its mechanism, called the rate-determining step. Unimolecular elementary reactions have first-order rate laws, while bimolecular elementary reactions have second-order rate laws. By comparing the rate laws derived from a reaction mechanism to that determined experimentally, the mechanism may be deemed either incorrect or plausible.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 12.7 Catalysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Catalysts affect the rate of a chemical reaction by altering its mechanism to provide a lower activation energy. Catalysts can be homogenous (in the same phase as the reactants) or heterogeneous (a different phase than the reactants).\n",
