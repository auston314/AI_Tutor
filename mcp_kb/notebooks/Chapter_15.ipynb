    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The mineral fluorite, $\\mathrm{CaF}_{2}$ Figure 15.1, is commonly used as a semiprecious stone in many types of jewelry because of its striking appearance. Deposits of fluorite are formed through a process called hydrothermal precipitation in which calcium and fluoride ions dissolved in groundwater combine to produce insoluble $\\mathrm{CaF}_{2}$ in response to some change in solution conditions. For example, a decrease in temperature may trigger fluorite precipitation if its solubility is exceeded at the lower temperature. Because fluoride ion is a weak base, its solubility is also affected by solution pH , and so geologic or other processes that change groundwater pH will also affect the precipitation of fluorite. This chapter extends the equilibrium discussion of other chapters by addressing some additional reaction classes (including precipitation) and systems involving coupled equilibrium reactions.\n",

    "### 15.1 Precipitation and Dissolution\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write chemical equations and equilibrium expressions representing solubility equilibria\n",
    "- Carry out equilibrium computations involving solubility, equilibrium expressions, and solute concentrations\n",
    "\n",
    "Solubility equilibria are established when the dissolution and precipitation of a solute species occur at equal rates. These equilibria underlie many natural and technological processes, ranging from tooth decay to water purification. An understanding of the factors affecting compound solubility is, therefore, essential to the effective management of these processes. This section applies previously introduced equilibrium concepts and tools to systems involving dissolution and precipitation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Solubility Product \n",
    "\n",
    "Recall from the chapter on solutions that the solubility of a substance can vary from essentially zero (insoluble or sparingly soluble) to infinity (miscible). A solute with finite solubility can yield a saturated solution when it is added to a solvent in an amount exceeding its solubility, resulting in a heterogeneous mixture of the saturated solution and the excess, undissolved solute. For example, a saturated solution of silver chloride is one in which the equilibrium shown below has been established.\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this solution, an excess of solid AgCl dissolves and dissociates to produce aqueous $\\mathrm{Ag}^{+}$and $\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ions at the same rate that these aqueous ions combine and precipitate to form solid AgCl (Figure 15.2). Because silver chloride is a sparingly soluble salt, the equilibrium concentration of its dissolved ions in the solution is relatively low.\n",

    "\n",
    "Figure 15.2 Silver chloride is a sparingly soluble ionic solid. When it is added to water, it dissolves slightly and produces a mixture consisting of a very dilute solution of $\\mathrm{Ag}^{+}$and $\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ions in equilibrium with undissolved silver chloride.\n",

Since the $K_{\\text {sp }}$ of barium sulfate is $2.3 \\times 10^{-8}$, very little of it dissolves as it coats the lining of the patient's intestinal tract.

Consider, for example, mixing aqueous solutions of the soluble compounds sodium carbonate and calcium nitrate. If the concentrations of calcium and carbonate ions in the mixture do not yield a reaction quotient, $Q_{s p}$, that exceeds the solubility product, $K_{\\mathrm{sp}}$, then no precipitation will occur. If the ion concentrations yield a reaction quotient greater than the solubility product, then precipitation will occur, lowering those concentrations until equilibrium is established $\\left(Q_{s p}=K_{s p}\\right)$. The comparison of $Q_{s p}$ to $K_{s p}$ to predict precipitation is an example of the general approach to predicting the direction of a reaction first introduced in the chapter on equilibrium. For the specific case of solubility equilibria:\n",

Specifically, selective precipitation is used to remove contaminants from wastewater before it is released back into natural bodies of water. For example, phosphate ions $\\left(\\mathrm{PO}_{4}{ }^{3-}\\right)$ are often present in the water discharged from manufacturing facilities. An abundance of phosphate causes excess algae to grow, which impacts the amount of oxygen available for marine life as well as making water unsuitable for human consumption.\n",

    "\n",
    "A coordinate covalent bond (or dative bond) occurs when one of the atoms in the bond provides both bonding electrons. For example, a coordinate covalent bond occurs when a water molecule combines with a hydrogen ion to form a hydronium ion. A coordinate covalent bond also results when an ammonia molecule combines with a hydrogen ion to form an ammonium ion. Both of these equations are shown here.\n",

Since it lacks a hydroxide ion, fluorapatite is more resistant to attacks by acids in our mouths and is thus less soluble, protecting our teeth. Scientists discovered that naturally fluorinated water could be beneficial to your teeth, and so it became common practice to add fluoride to drinking water. Toothpastes and mouthwashes also contain amounts of fluoride (Figure 15.9).\n",

    "Figure 15.9 Fluoride, found in many toothpastes, helps prevent tooth decay (credit: Kerry Ceszyk).\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, excess fluoride can negate its advantages. Natural sources of drinking water in various parts of the world have varying concentrations of fluoride, and places where that concentration is high are prone to certain health risks when there is no other source of drinking water. The most serious side effect of excess fluoride is the bone disease, skeletal fluorosis. When excess fluoride is in the body, it can cause the joints to stiffen and the bones to thicken. It can severely impact mobility and can negatively affect the thyroid gland. Skeletal fluorosis is a condition that over 2.7 million people suffer from across the world. So while fluoride can protect our teeth from decay, the US Environmental Protection Agency sets a maximum level of 4 ppm ( $4 \\mathrm{mg} /$ L) of fluoride in drinking water in the US. Fluoride levels in water are not regulated in all countries, so fluorosis is a problem in areas with high levels of fluoride in the groundwater.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 15.1 Precipitation and Dissolution\n",
    "\n",
    "The equilibrium constant for an equilibrium involving the precipitation or dissolution of a slightly soluble ionic solid is called the solubility product, $K_{\\text {sp }}$, of the solid. For a heterogeneous equilibrium involving the slightly soluble solid $\\mathrm{M}_{p} \\mathrm{X}_{q}$ and its ions $\\mathrm{M}^{\\mathrm{m}+}$ and $\\mathrm{X}^{\\mathrm{n}-}$ :\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "K_{\\mathrm{sp}}=\\left[\\mathrm{M}^{\\mathrm{m}+}\\right]^{p}\\left[\\mathrm{X}^{\\mathrm{n}-}\\right]^{q}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The solubility product of a slightly soluble electrolyte can be calculated from its solubility; conversely, its solubility can be calculated from its $K_{\\text {sp }}$, provided the only significant reaction that occurs when the solid dissolves is the formation of its ions.\n",
    "\n",
    "A slightly soluble electrolyte begins to precipitate when the magnitude of the reaction quotient for the dissolution reaction exceeds the magnitude of the solubility product. Precipitation continues until the reaction quotient equals the solubility product.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 15.2 Lewis Acids and Bases \n",
    "\n",
    "A Lewis acid is a species that can accept an electron pair, whereas a Lewis base has an electron pair available for donation to a Lewis acid. Complex ions are examples of Lewis acid-base adducts and comprise central metal atoms or ions acting as Lewis acids bonded to molecules or ions called ligands that act as Lewis bases. The equilibrium constant for the reaction between a metal ion and ligands produces a complex ion called a formation constant; for the reverse reaction, it is called a dissociation constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 15.3 Coupled Equilibria\n",
    "\n",
    "Systems involving two or more chemical equilibria that share one or more reactant or product are called coupled equilibria. Common examples of coupled equilibria include the increased solubility of some compounds in acidic solutions (coupled dissolution and neutralization equilibria) and in solutions containing ligands (coupled dissolution and complex formation). The equilibrium tools from other chapters may be applied to describe and perform calculations on these systems.\n",
