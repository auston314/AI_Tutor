    "Swimming pools have long been a popular means of recreation, exercise, and physical therapy. Since it is impractical to refill large pools with fresh water on a frequent basis, pool water is regularly treated with chemicals to prevent the growth of harmful bacteria and algae. Proper pool maintenance requires regular additions of various chemical compounds in carefully measured amounts. For example, the relative amount of calcium ion, $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, in the water should be maintained within certain limits to prevent eye irritation and avoid damage to the pool bed and plumbing. To maintain proper calcium levels, calcium cations are added to the water in the form of an ionic compound that also contains anions; thus, it is necessary to know both the relative amount of $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ in the compound and the volume of water in the pool in order to achieve the proper calcium level. Quantitative aspects of the composition of substances (such as the calcium-containing compound) and mixtures (such as the pool water) are the subject of this chapter.\n",

    "Many argue that modern chemical science began when scientists started exploring the quantitative as well as the qualitative aspects of chemistry. For example, Dalton's atomic theory was an attempt to explain the results of measurements that allowed him to calculate the relative masses of elements combined in various compounds. Understanding the relationship between the masses of atoms and the chemical formulas of compounds allows us to quantitatively describe the composition of substances.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Formula Mass\n",
    "\n",
    "An earlier chapter of this text described the development of the atomic mass unit, the concept of average atomic masses, and the use of chemical formulas to represent the elemental makeup of substances. These ideas can be extended to calculate the formula mass of a substance by summing the average atomic masses of all the atoms represented in the substance's formula.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Formula Mass for Covalent Substances\n",
    "\n",
    "For covalent substances, the formula represents the numbers and types of atoms composing a single molecule of the substance; therefore, the formula mass may be correctly referred to as a molecular mass. Consider chloroform $\\left(\\mathrm{CHCl}_{3}\\right)$, a covalent compound once used as a surgical anesthetic and now primarily used in the production of tetrafluoroethylene, the building block for the \"anti-stick\" polymer, Teflon. The molecular formula of chloroform indicates that a single molecule contains one carbon atom, one hydrogen atom, and three chlorine atoms. The average molecular mass of a chloroform molecule is therefore equal to the sum of the average atomic masses of these atoms. Figure 3.2 outlines the calculations used to derive the molecular mass of chloroform, which is 119.37 amu.\n",

    "Likewise, the molecular mass of an aspirin molecule, $\\mathrm{C}_{9} \\mathrm{H}_{8} \\mathrm{O}_{4}$, is the sum of the atomic masses of nine carbon atoms, eight hydrogen atoms, and four oxygen atoms, which amounts to 180.15 amu (Figure 3.3).\n",

    "#### Formula Mass for Ionic Compounds\n",
    "\n",
    "Ionic compounds are composed of discrete cations and anions combined in ratios to yield electrically neutral bulk matter. The formula mass for an ionic compound is calculated in the same way as the formula mass for covalent compounds: by summing the average atomic masses of all the atoms in the compound's formula. Keep in mind, however, that the formula for an ionic compound does not represent the composition of a discrete molecule, so it may not correctly be referred to as the \"molecular mass.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, consider sodium chloride, NaCl , the chemical name for common table salt. Sodium chloride is an ionic compound composed of sodium cations, $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$, and chloride anions, $\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$, combined in a 1:1 ratio. The formula mass for this compound is computed as 58.44 amu (see Figure 3.4).\n",

    "\n",
    "Note that the average masses of neutral sodium and chlorine atoms were used in this computation, rather than the masses for sodium cations and chlorine anions. This approach is perfectly acceptable when computing the formula mass of an ionic compound. Even though a sodium cation has a slightly smaller mass than a sodium atom (since it is missing an electron), this difference will be offset by the fact that a chloride anion is slightly more massive than a chloride atom (due to the extra electron). Moreover, the mass of an electron is negligibly small with respect to the mass of a typical atom. Even when calculating the mass of an isolated ion, the missing or additional electrons can generally be ignored, since their contribution to the overall mass is negligible, reflected only in the nonsignificant digits that will be lost when the computed mass is properly rounded. The few exceptions to this guideline are very light ions derived from elements with precisely known atomic masses.\n",

    "#### The Mole\n",
    "\n",
    "The identity of a substance is defined not only by the types of atoms or ions it contains, but by the quantity of\n",
    "\n",
    "each type of atom or ion. For example, water, $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$, and hydrogen peroxide, $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{2}$, are alike in that their respective molecules are composed of hydrogen and oxygen atoms. However, because a hydrogen peroxide molecule contains two oxygen atoms, as opposed to the water molecule, which has only one, the two substances exhibit very different properties. Today, sophisticated instruments allow the direct measurement of these defining microscopic traits; however, the same traits were originally derived from the measurement of macroscopic properties (the masses and volumes of bulk quantities of matter) using relatively simple tools (balances and volumetric glassware). This experimental approach required the introduction of a new unit for amount of substances, the mole, which remains indispensable in modern chemical science.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mole is an amount unit similar to familiar units like pair, dozen, gross, etc. It provides a specific measure of the number of atoms or molecules in a bulk sample of matter. A mole is defined as the amount of substance containing the same number of discrete entities (such as atoms, molecules, and ions) as the number of atoms in a sample of pure ${ }^{12} \\mathrm{C}$ weighing exactly 12 g . One Latin connotation for the word \"mole\" is \"large mass\" or \"bulk,\" which is consistent with its use as the name for this unit. The mole provides a link between an easily measured macroscopic property, bulk mass, and an extremely important fundamental property, number of atoms, molecules, and so forth.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of entities composing a mole has been experimentally determined to be $6.02214179 \\times 10^{23}$, a fundamental constant named Avogadro's number $\\left(\\boldsymbol{N}_{\\boldsymbol{A}}\\right)$ or the Avogadro constant in honor of Italian scientist Amedeo Avogadro. This constant is properly reported with an explicit unit of \"per mole,\" a conveniently rounded version being $6.022 \\times 10^{23} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consistent with its definition as an amount unit, 1 mole of any element contains the same number of atoms as 1 mole of any other element. The masses of 1 mole of different elements, however, are different, since the masses of the individual atoms are drastically different. The molar mass of an element (or compound) is the mass in grams of 1 mole of that substance, a property expressed in units of grams per mole ( $\\mathrm{g} / \\mathrm{mol}$ ) (see Figure 3.5).\n",

    "\n",
    "Because the definitions of both the mole and the atomic mass unit are based on the same reference substance, ${ }^{12} \\mathrm{C}$, the molar mass of any substance is numerically equivalent to its atomic or formula weight in amu. Per the amu definition, a single ${ }^{12} \\mathrm{C}$ atom weighs 12 amu (its atomic mass is 12 amu ). According to the definition of the mole, 12 g of ${ }^{12} \\mathrm{C}$ contains 1 mole of ${ }^{12} \\mathrm{C}$ atoms (its molar mass is $12 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$ ). This relationship holds for all elements, since their atomic\n",

It sends and receives signals to and from muscles and other internal organs to monitor and control their functions; it processes stimuli detected by sensory organs to guide interactions with the external world; and it houses the complex physiological processes that give rise to our intellect and emotions. The broad field of neuroscience spans all aspects of the structure and function of the central nervous system, including research on the anatomy and physiology of the brain. Great progress has been made in brain research over the past few decades, and the BRAIN Initiative, a federal initiative announced in 2013, aims to accelerate and capitalize on these advances through the concerted efforts of various industrial, academic, and government agencies (more details available at www.whitehouse.gov/share/brain-initiative).\n",

    "\n",
    "Specialized cells called neurons transmit information between different parts of the central nervous system by way of electrical and chemical signals. Chemical signaling occurs at the interface between different neurons when one of the cells releases molecules (called neurotransmitters) that diffuse across the small gap between the cells (called the synapse) and bind to the surface of the other cell. These neurotransmitter molecules are stored in small intracellular structures called vesicles that fuse to the cell wall and then break open to release their contents when the neuron is appropriately stimulated. This process is called exocytosis (see Figure 3.10). One neurotransmitter that has been very extensively studied is dopamine, $\\mathrm{C}_{6} \\mathrm{H}_{11} \\mathrm{NO}_{2}$. Dopamine is involved in various neurological processes that impact a wide variety of human behaviors. Dysfunctions in the dopamine systems of the brain underlie serious neurological diseases such as Parkinson's and schizophrenia.\n",

    "\n",
    "One important aspect of the complex processes related to dopamine signaling is the number of neurotransmitter molecules released during exocytosis. Since this number is a central factor in determining neurological response (and subsequent human thought and action), it is important to know how this number changes with certain controlled stimulations, such as the administration of drugs. It is also important to understand the mechanism responsible for any changes in the number of neurotransmitter molecules released-for example, some dysfunction in exocytosis, a change in the number of vesicles in the neuron, or a change in the number of neurotransmitter molecules in each vesicle.\n",
    "Significant progress has been made recently in directly measuring the number of dopamine molecules stored in individual vesicles and the amount actually released when the vesicle undergoes exocytosis. Using miniaturized probes that can selectively detect dopamine molecules in very small amounts, scientists have determined that the vesicles of a certain type of mouse brain neuron contain an average of 30,000 dopamine molecules per vesicle (about $5 \\times 10^{-20} \\mathrm{~mol}$ or 50 zmol ). Analysis of these neurons from mice subjected to various drug therapies shows significant changes in the average number of dopamine molecules contained in individual vesicles, increasing or decreasing by up to three-fold, depending on the specific drug used. These studies also indicate that not all of the dopamine in a given vesicle is released during exocytosis, suggesting that it may be possible to regulate the fraction released using pharmaceutical therapies. ${ }^{[1]}$\n",

However, keep in mind that chemical formulas represent the relative numbers, not masses, of atoms in the substance. Therefore, any experimentally derived data involving mass must be used to derive the corresponding numbers of atoms in the compound. This is accomplished using molar masses to convert the mass of each element to a number of moles. These molar amounts are used to compute whole-number ratios that can be used to derive the empirical formula of the substance. Consider a sample of compound determined to contain 1.71 g C and 0.287 g H . The corresponding numbers of atoms (in moles) are:\n",

    "Finally, with regard to deriving empirical formulas, consider instances in which a compound's percent composition is available rather than the absolute masses of the compound's constituent elements. In such cases, the percent composition can be used to calculate the masses of elements present in any convenient mass of compound; these masses can then be used to derive the empirical formula in the usual fashion.\n",

    "Since the scale for percentages is 100 , it is most convenient to calculate the mass of elements present in a sample weighing 100 g . The calculation is \"most convenient\" because, per the definition for percent composition, the mass of a given element in grams is numerically equivalent to the element's mass percentage. This numerical equivalence results from the definition of the \"percentage\" unit, whose name is derived from the Latin phrase per centum meaning \"by the hundred.\" Considering this definition, the mass percentages provided may be more conveniently expressed as fractions:\n",

    "#### Derivation of Molecular Formulas\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that empirical formulas are symbols representing the relative numbers of a compound's elements. Determining the absolute numbers of atoms that compose a single molecule of a covalent compound requires knowledge of both its empirical formula and its molecular mass or molar mass. These quantities may be determined experimentally by various measurement techniques. Molecular mass, for example, is often derived from the mass spectrum of the compound (see discussion of this technique in the previous chapter on atoms and molecules). Molar mass can be measured by a number of experimental methods, many of which will be introduced in later chapters of this text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Molecular formulas are derived by comparing the compound's molecular or molar mass to its empirical formula mass. As the name suggests, an empirical formula mass is the sum of the average atomic masses of all the atoms represented in an empirical formula. If the molecular (or molar) mass of the substance is known, it may be divided by the empirical formula mass to yield the number of empirical formula units per molecule $(n)$ :\n",

    "$$\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a covalent compound whose empirical formula is determined to be $\\mathrm{CH}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$. The empirical formula mass for this compound is approximately 30 amu (the sum of 12 amu for one C atom, 2 amu for two H atoms, and 16 amu for one O atom). If the compound's molecular mass is determined to be 180 amu , this indicates that molecules of this compound contain six times the number of atoms represented in the empirical formula:\n",

Similar to a pure substance, the relative composition of a mixture plays an important role in determining its properties. The relative amount of oxygen in a planet's atmosphere determines its ability to sustain aerobic life. The relative amounts of iron, carbon, nickel, and other elements in steel (a mixture known as an \"alloy\") determine its physical strength and resistance to corrosion. The relative amount of the active ingredient in a medicine determines its effectiveness in achieving the desired pharmacological effect. The relative amount of sugar in a beverage determines its sweetness (see Figure 3.14). This section will describe one of the most common ways in which the relative compositions of mixtures may be quantified.\n",

A more thorough treatment of solution properties is provided in the chapter on solutions and colloids, but provided here is an introduction to some of the basic properties of solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The relative amount of a given solution component is known as its concentration. Often, though not always, a solution contains one component with a concentration that is significantly greater than that of all other components. This component is called the solvent and may be viewed as the medium in which the other components are dispersed, or dissolved. Solutions in which water is the solvent are, of course, very common on our planet. A solution in which water is the solvent is called an aqueous solution.\n",

    "Concentrations may be quantitatively assessed using a wide variety of measurement units, each convenient for particular applications.

Due to the use of the same reference substance in defining the atomic mass unit and the mole, the formula mass (amu) and molar mass ( $\\mathrm{g} / \\mathrm{mol}$ ) for any substance are numerically equivalent (for example, one $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$ molecule weighs approximately 18 amu and 1 mole of $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$ molecules weighs approximately 18 g ).\n",

    "#### 3.2 Determining Empirical and Molecular Formulas\n",
    "\n",
    "The chemical identity of a substance is defined by the types and relative numbers of atoms composing its fundamental entities (molecules in the case of covalent compounds, ions in the case of ionic compounds). A compound's percent composition provides the mass percentage of each element in the compound, and it is often experimentally determined and used to derive the compound's empirical formula. The empirical formula mass of a covalent compound may be compared to the compound's molecular or molar mass to derive a molecular formula.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.3 Molarity\n",
    "\n",
    "Solutions are homogeneous mixtures. Many solutions contain one component, called the solvent, in which other components, called solutes, are dissolved. An aqueous solution is one for which the solvent is water. The concentration of a solution is a measure of the relative amount of solute in a given amount of solution. Concentrations may be measured using various units, with one very useful unit being molarity, defined as the number of moles of solute per liter of solution. The solute concentration of a solution may be decreased by adding solvent, a process referred to as dilution. The dilution equation is a simple relation between concentrations and volumes of a solution before and after dilution.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.4 Other Units for Solution Concentrations\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to molarity, a number of other solution concentration units are used in various applications. Percentage concentrations based on the solution components' masses, volumes, or both are useful for expressing relatively high concentrations, whereas lower concentrations are conveniently expressed using ppm or ppb units. These units are popular in environmental, medical, and other fields where mole-based units such as molarity are not as commonly used.\n",
