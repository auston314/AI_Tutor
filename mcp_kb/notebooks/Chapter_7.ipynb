    "\n",
    "It has long been known that pure carbon occurs in different forms (allotropes) including graphite and diamonds. But it was not until 1985 that a new form of carbon was recognized: buckminsterfullerene. This molecule was named after the architect and inventor R. Buckminster Fuller (1895-1983), whose signature architectural design was the geodesic dome, characterized by a lattice shell structure supporting a spherical surface. Experimental evidence revealed the formula, $\\mathrm{C}_{60}$, and then scientists determined how 60 carbon atoms could form one symmetric, stable molecule. They were guided by bonding theory-the topic of this chapter-which explains how individual atoms connect to form more complex structures.\n",

    "### 7.1 Ionic Bonding \n",

    "By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Explain the formation of cations, anions, and ionic compounds\n",
    "- Predict the charge of common metallic and nonmetallic elements, and write their electron configurations\n",
    "\n",
    "As you have learned, ions are atoms or molecules bearing an electrical charge. A cation (a positive ion) forms when a neutral atom loses one or more electrons from its valence shell, and an anion (a negative ion) forms when a neutral atom gains one or more electrons in its valence shell.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compounds composed of ions are called ionic compounds (or salts), and their constituent ions are held together by ionic bonds: electrostatic forces of attraction between oppositely charged cations and anions. The properties of ionic compounds shed some light on the nature of ionic bonds. Ionic solids exhibit a crystalline structure and tend to be rigid and brittle; they also tend to have high melting and boiling points, which suggests that ionic bonds are very strong. Ionic solids are also poor conductors of electricity for the same reason-the strength of ionic bonds prevents ions from moving freely in the solid state. Most ionic solids, however, dissolve readily in water. Once dissolved or melted, ionic compounds are excellent conductors of electricity and heat because the ions can move about freely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neutral atoms and their associated ions have very different physical and chemical properties. Sodium atoms form sodium metal, a soft, silvery-white metal that burns vigorously in air and reacts explosively with water. Chlorine atoms form chlorine gas, $\\mathrm{Cl}_{2}$, a yellow-green gas that is extremely corrosive to most metals and very poisonous to animals and plants. The vigorous reaction between the elements sodium and chlorine forms the white, crystalline compound sodium chloride, common table salt, which contains sodium cations and chloride anions (Figure 7.2). The compound composed of these ions exhibits properties entirely different from the properties of the elements sodium and chlorine. Chlorine is poisonous, but sodium chloride is essential to life; sodium atoms react vigorously with water, but sodium chloride simply dissolves in water.\n",

(c) When combined, they form white crystals of sodium chloride (table salt). (credit a: modification of work by \"Jurii\"/Wikimedia Commons)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Formation of Ionic Compounds\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary ionic compounds are composed of just two elements: a metal (which forms the cations) and a nonmetal (which forms the anions). For example, NaCl is a binary ionic compound. We can think about the formation of such compounds in terms of the periodic properties of the elements. Many metallic elements have relatively low ionization potentials and lose electrons easily. These elements lie to the left in a period or near the bottom of a group on the periodic table. Nonmetal atoms have relatively high electron affinities and thus readily gain electrons lost by metal atoms, thereby filling their valence shells. Nonmetallic elements are found in the upper-right corner of the periodic table.\n",
    "\n",
    "As all substances must be electrically neutral, the total number of positive charges on the cations of an ionic compound must equal the total number of negative charges on its anions. The formula of an ionic compound represents the simplest ratio of the numbers of ions necessary to give identical numbers of positive and negative charges. For example, the formula for aluminum oxide, $\\mathrm{Al}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{3}$, indicates that this ionic compound contains two aluminum cations, $\\mathrm{Al}^{3+}$, for every three oxide anions, $\\mathrm{O}^{2-}$ [thus, $(2 \\times+3)+(3 \\times-2)=0$ ].\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note, however, that the formula for an ionic compound does not represent the physical arrangement of its ions. It is incorrect to refer to a sodium chloride $(\\mathrm{NaCl})$ \"molecule\" because there is not a single ionic bond, per se, between any specific pair of sodium and chloride ions. The attractive forces between ions are isotropic-the same in all directions-meaning that any particular ion is equally attracted to all of the nearby ions of opposite charge. This results in the ions arranging themselves into a tightly bound, three-dimensional lattice structure. Sodium chloride, for example, consists of a regular arrangement of equal numbers of $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$cations and $\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$anions (Figure 7.3).\n",
    "![Image](Chapter_7_images/img-2.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 7.3 The atoms in sodium chloride (common table salt) are arranged to (a) maximize opposite charges interacting. The smaller spheres represent sodium ions, the larger ones represent chloride ions. In the expanded view (b), the geometry can be seen more clearly. Note that each ion is \"bonded\" to all of the surrounding ions-six in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "The strong electrostatic attraction between $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ions holds them tightly together in solid NaCl . It requires 769 kJ of energy to dissociate one mole of solid NaCl into separate gaseous $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ions:\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Electronic Structures of Cations \n",
    "\n",
    "When forming a cation, an atom of a main group element tends to lose all of its valence electrons, thus assuming the electronic structure of the noble gas that precedes it in the periodic table. For groups 1 (the alkali metals) and 2 (the alkaline earth metals), the group numbers are equal to the numbers of valence shell electrons and, consequently, to the charges of the cations formed from atoms of these elements when all valence shell electrons are removed. For example, calcium is a group 2 element whose neutral atoms have 20 electrons and a ground state electron configuration of $1 s^{2} 2 s^{2} 2 p^{6} 3 s^{2} 3 p^{6} 4 s^{2}$. When a Ca atom loses both of its valence electrons, the result is a cation with 18 electrons, a $2+$ charge, and an electron configuration of $1 s^{2} 2 s^{2} 2 p^{6} 3 s^{2} 3 p^{6}$. The $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ ion is therefore isoelectronic with the noble gas Ar.\n",
    "\n",
    "For groups 13-17, the group numbers exceed the number of valence electrons by 10 (accounting for the possibility of full $d$ subshells in atoms of elements in the fourth and greater periods). Thus, the charge of a cation formed by the loss of all valence electrons is equal to the group number minus 10 . For example, aluminum (in group 13) forms 3+ ions $\\left(\\mathrm{Al}^{3+}\\right)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions to the expected behavior involve elements toward the bottom of the groups. In addition to the expected ions $\\mathrm{Tl}^{3+}, \\mathrm{Sn}^{4+}, \\mathrm{Pb}^{4+}$, and $\\mathrm{Bi}^{5+}$, a partial loss of these atoms' valence shell electrons can also lead to the formation\n",
    "\n",
    "of $\\mathrm{Tl}^{+}, \\mathrm{Sn}^{2+}, \\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$, and $\\mathrm{Bi}^{3+}$ ions. The formation of these $1+, 2+$, and $3+$ cations is ascribed to the inert pair effect, which reflects the relatively low energy of the valence $s$-electron pair for atoms of the heavy elements of groups 13, 14 , and 15. Mercury (group 12) also exhibits an unexpected behavior: it forms a diatomic ion, $\\mathrm{Hg}_{2}{ }^{2+}$ (an ion formed from two mercury atoms, with an $\\mathrm{Hg}-\\mathrm{Hg}$ bond), in addition to the expected monatomic ion $\\mathrm{Hg}^{2+}$ (formed from only one mercury atom).\n",
    "\n",
    "Transition and inner transition metal elements behave differently than main group elements. Most transition metal cations have $2+$ or $3+$ charges that result from the loss of their outermost $s$ electron(s) first, sometimes followed by the loss of one or two $d$ electrons from the next-to-outermost shell. For example, iron $\\left(1 s^{2} 2 s^{2} 2 p^{6} 3 s^{2} 3 p^{6} 3 d^{6} 4 s^{2}\\right)$ forms the ion $\\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}\\left(1 s^{2} 2 s^{2} 2 p^{6} 3 s^{2} 3 p^{6} 3 d^{6}\\right)$ by the loss of the $4 s$ electron and the ion $\\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}\\left(1 s^{2} 2 s^{2} 2 p^{6} 3 s^{2} 3 p^{6} 3 d^{5}\\right)$ by the loss of the $4 s$ electron and one of the $3 d$ electrons. Although the $d$ orbitals of the transition elements are-according to the Aufbau principle-the last to fill when building up electron configurations, the outermost $s$ electrons are the first to be lost when these atoms ionize. When the inner transition metals form ions, they usually have a $3+$ charge, resulting from the loss of their outermost $s$ electrons and a $d$ or $f$ electron.\n",

    "There are at least 14 elements categorized as \"essential trace elements\" for the human body. They are called \"essential\" because they are required for healthy bodily functions, \"trace\" because they are required only in small amounts, and \"elements\" in spite of the fact that they are really ions. Two of these essential trace elements, chromium and zinc, are required as $\\mathrm{Cr}^{3+}$ and $\\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}$. Write the electron configurations of these cations.\n",

    "Next, remove electrons from the highest energy orbital. For the transition metals, electrons are removed from the $s$ orbital first and then from the $d$ orbital. For the $p$-block elements, electrons are removed from the $p$ orbitals and then from the $s$ orbital. Zinc is a member of group 12, so it should have a charge of $2+$, and thus loses only the two electrons in its $s$ orbital. Chromium is a transition element and should lose its $s$ electrons and then its $d$ electrons when forming a cation. Thus, we find the following electron configurations of the ions:\n",

Oxygen, for example, has the electron configuration $1 s^{2} 2 s^{2} 2 p^{4}$, whereas the oxygen anion has the electron configuration of the noble gas neon $(\\mathrm{Ne}), 1 s^{2} 2 s^{2} 2 p^{6}$.

    "\n",
    "By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Describe the formation of covalent bonds\n",
    "- Define electronegativity and assess the polarity of covalent bonds\n",
    "\n",
    "Ionic bonding results from the electrostatic attraction of oppositely charged ions that are typically produced by the transfer of electrons between metallic and nonmetallic atoms. A different type of bonding results from the mutual attraction of atoms for a \"shared\" pair of electrons. Such bonds are called covalent bonds. Covalent bonds are formed between two atoms when both have similar tendencies to attract electrons to themselves (i.e., when both atoms have identical or fairly similar ionization energies and electron affinities). For example, two hydrogen atoms bond covalently to form an $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$ molecule; each hydrogen atom in the $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$ molecule has two electrons stabilizing it, giving each atom the same number of valence electrons as the noble gas He .\n",
    "\n",
    "Compounds that contain covalent bonds exhibit different physical properties than ionic compounds. Because the attraction between molecules, which are electrically neutral, is weaker than that between electrically charged ions, covalent compounds generally have much lower melting and boiling points than ionic compounds. In fact, many covalent compounds are liquids or gases at room temperature, and, in their solid states, they are typically much softer than ionic solids. Furthermore, whereas ionic compounds are good conductors of electricity when dissolved in water, most covalent compounds are insoluble in water, since they are electrically neutral, they are poor conductors of electricity in any state.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Formation of Covalent Bonds\n",
    "\n",
    "Nonmetal atoms frequently form covalent bonds with other nonmetal atoms. For example, the hydrogen molecule, $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$, contains a covalent bond between its two hydrogen atoms. Figure 7.4 illustrates why this bond is formed. Starting on the far right, we have two separate hydrogen atoms with a particular potential energy, indicated by the red line. Along the $x$-axis is the distance between the two atoms. As the two atoms approach each other (moving left along the $x$-axis), their valence orbitals ( $1 s$ ) begin to overlap. The single electrons on each hydrogen atom then interact with both atomic nuclei, occupying the space around both atoms. The strong attraction of each shared electron to both nuclei stabilizes the system, and the potential energy decreases as the bond distance decreases. If the atoms continue to approach each other, the positive charges in the two nuclei begin to repel each other, and the potential energy increases. The bond length is determined by the distance at which the lowest potential energy is achieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Image](Chapter_7_images/img-3.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 7.4 The potential energy of two separate hydrogen atoms (right) decreases as they approach each other, and the single electrons on each atom are shared to form a covalent bond. The bond length is the internuclear distance at which the lowest potential energy is achieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is essential to remember that energy must be added to break chemical bonds (an endothermic process), whereas forming chemical bonds releases energy (an exothermic process). In the case of $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$, the covalent bond is very strong; a large amount of energy, 436 kJ , must be added to break the bonds in one mole of hydrogen molecules and cause the atoms to separate:\n",

    "\\mathrm{H}_{2}(g) \\longrightarrow 2 \\mathrm{H}(g) \\quad \\Delta H=436 \\mathrm{~kJ}\n",

    "Conversely, the same amount of energy is released when one mole of $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$ molecules forms from two moles of H atoms:\n",

    "2 \\mathrm{H}(g) \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{H}_{2}(g) \\quad \\Delta H=-436 \\mathrm{~kJ}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pure vs. Polar Covalent Bonds \n",
    "\n",
    "If the atoms that form a covalent bond are identical, as in $\\mathrm{H}_{2}, \\mathrm{Cl}_{2}$, and other diatomic molecules, then the electrons in the bond must be shared equally. We refer to this as a pure covalent bond. Electrons shared in pure covalent bonds have an equal probability of being near each nucleus.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of $\\mathrm{Cl}_{2}$, each atom starts off with seven valence electrons, and each Cl shares one electron with the other, forming one covalent bond:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathrm{Cl}+\\mathrm{Cl} \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{Cl}_{2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The total number of electrons around each individual atom consists of six nonbonding electrons and two shared (i.e., bonding) electrons for eight total electrons, matching the number of valence electrons in the noble gas argon. Since the bonding atoms are identical, $\\mathrm{Cl}_{2}$ also features a pure covalent bond.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the atoms linked by a covalent bond are different, the bonding electrons are shared, but no longer equally. Instead, the bonding electrons are more attracted to one atom than the other, giving rise to a shift of electron density toward that atom. This unequal distribution of electrons is known as a polar covalent bond, characterized by a partial positive charge on one atom and a partial negative charge on the other. The atom that attracts the electrons more strongly acquires the partial negative charge and vice versa. For example, the electrons in the $\\mathrm{H}-\\mathrm{Cl}$ bond of a hydrogen chloride molecule spend more time near the chlorine atom than near the hydrogen atom. Thus, in an HCl molecule, the chlorine atom carries a partial negative charge and the hydrogen atom has a partial positive charge. Figure 7.5 shows the distribution of electrons in the $\\mathrm{H}-\\mathrm{Cl}$ bond. Note that the shaded area around Cl is much larger than it is around H . Compare this to Figure 7.4, which shows the even distribution of electrons in the $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$ nonpolar bond.\n",
    "\n",
    "We sometimes designate the positive and negative atoms in a polar covalent bond using a lowercase Greek letter \"delta,\" $\\delta$, with a plus sign or minus sign to indicate whether the atom has a partial positive charge ( $\\delta+$ ) or a partial negative charge ( $\\delta-$ ). This symbolism is shown for the $\\mathrm{H}-\\mathrm{Cl}$ molecule in Figure 7.5.\n",

    "\n",
    "Figure 7.5 (a) The distribution of electron density in the HCl molecule is uneven. The electron density is greater around the chlorine nucleus. The small, black dots indicate the location of the hydrogen and chlorine nuclei in the molecule. (b) Symbols $\\delta+$ and $\\delta-$ indicate the polarity of the $\\mathrm{H}-\\mathrm{Cl}$ bond.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Electronegativity\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether a bond is nonpolar or polar covalent is determined by a property of the bonding atoms called electronegativity. Electronegativity is a measure of the tendency of an atom to attract electrons (or electron density) towards itself. It determines how the shared electrons are distributed between the two atoms in a bond. The more strongly an atom attracts the electrons in its bonds, the larger its electronegativity. Electrons in a polar covalent bond are shifted toward the more electronegative atom; thus, the more electronegative atom is the one with the partial negative charge. The greater the difference in electronegativity, the more polarized the electron distribution and the larger the partial charges of the atoms.\n",
    "Figure 7.6 shows the electronegativity values of the elements as proposed by one of the most famous chemists of the twentieth century: Linus Pauling (Figure 7.7). In general, electronegativity increases from left to right across a period in the periodic table and decreases down a group. Thus, the nonmetals, which lie in the upper right, tend to have the highest electronegativities, with fluorine the most electronegative element of all ( $\\mathrm{EN}=4.0$ ). Metals tend to\n",
    "\n",
    "be less electronegative elements, and the group 1 metals have the lowest electronegativities. Note that noble gases are excluded from this figure because these atoms usually do not share electrons with others atoms since they have a full valence shell. (While noble gas compounds such as $\\mathrm{XeO}_{2}$ do exist, they can only be formed under extreme conditions, and thus they do not fit neatly into the general model of electronegativity.)\n",
    "![Image](Chapter_7_images/img-5.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 7.6 The electronegativity values derived by Pauling follow predictable periodic trends, with the higher electronegativities toward the upper right of the periodic table.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Electronegativity versus Electron Affinity \n",
    "\n",
    "We must be careful not to confuse electronegativity and electron affinity. The electron affinity of an element is a measurable physical quantity, namely, the energy released or absorbed when an isolated gas-phase atom acquires an electron, measured in $\\mathrm{kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$. Electronegativity, on the other hand, describes how tightly an atom attracts electrons in a bond. It is a dimensionless quantity that is calculated, not measured. Pauling derived the first electronegativity values by comparing the amounts of energy required to break different types of bonds. He chose an arbitrary relative scale ranging from 0 to 4 .\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Portrait of a Chemist\n",
    "\n",
    "**Linus Pauling**\n",
    "\n",
    "Linus Pauling, shown in Figure 7.7, is the only person to have received two unshared (individual) Nobel Prizes: one for chemistry in 1954 for his work on the nature of chemical bonds and one for peace in 1962 for his opposition to weapons of mass destruction. He developed many of the theories and concepts that are foundational to our current understanding of chemistry, including electronegativity and resonance structures.\n",

    "Pauling also contributed to many other fields besides chemistry. His research on sickle cell anemia revealed the cause of the disease-the presence of a genetically inherited abnormal protein in the blood-and paved the way for the field of molecular genetics. His work was also pivotal in curbing the testing of nuclear weapons; he proved that radioactive fallout from nuclear testing posed a public health risk.\n",

    "#### Electronegativity and Bond Type \n",
    "\n",
    "The absolute value of the difference in electronegativity ( $\\Delta \\mathrm{EN}$ ) of two bonded atoms provides a rough measure of the polarity to be expected in the bond and, thus, the bond type. When the difference is very small or zero, the bond is covalent and nonpolar. When it is large, the bond is polar covalent or ionic. The absolute values of the electronegativity differences between the atoms in the bonds $\\mathrm{H}-\\mathrm{H}, \\mathrm{H}-\\mathrm{Cl}$, and $\\mathrm{Na}-\\mathrm{Cl}$ are 0 (nonpolar), 0.9 (polar covalent), and 2.1 (ionic), respectively. The degree to which electrons are shared between atoms varies from completely equal (pure covalent bonding) to not at all (ionic bonding). Figure 7.8 shows the relationship between electronegativity difference and bond type.\n",

    "\n",
    "The best guide to the covalent or ionic character of a bond is to consider the types of atoms involved and their relative positions in the periodic table. Bonds between two nonmetals are generally covalent; bonding between a metal and a nonmetal is often ionic.\n",

    "Some compounds contain both covalent and ionic bonds. The atoms in polyatomic ions, such as $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}, \\mathrm{NO}_{3}{ }^{-}$, and $\\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$, are held together by polar covalent bonds. However, these polyatomic ions form ionic compounds by combining with ions of opposite charge. For example, potassium nitrate, $\\mathrm{KNO}_{3}$, contains the $\\mathrm{K}^{+}$cation and the polyatomic $\\mathrm{NO}_{3}{ }^{-}$anion. Thus, bonding in potassium nitrate is ionic, resulting from the electrostatic attraction between the ions $\\mathrm{K}^{+}$and $\\mathrm{NO}_{3}{ }^{-}$, as well as covalent between the nitrogen and oxygen atoms in $\\mathrm{NO}_{3}{ }^{-}$.\n",

    "#### Lewis Structures \n",
    "\n",
    "We also use Lewis symbols to indicate the formation of covalent bonds, which are shown in Lewis structures, drawings that describe the bonding in molecules and polyatomic ions. For example, when two chlorine atoms form a chlorine molecule, they share one pair of electrons:\n",
    "![Image](Chapter_7_images/img-11.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Lewis structure indicates that each Cl atom has three pairs of electrons that are not used in bonding (called lone pairs) and one shared pair of electrons (written between the atoms). A dash (or line) is sometimes used to indicate a shared pair of electrons:\n",

    "A single shared pair of electrons is called a single bond. Each Cl atom interacts with eight valence electrons: the six in the lone pairs and the two in the single bond.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Octet Rule\n",
    "\n",
    "The other halogen molecules $\\left(\\mathrm{F}_{2}, \\mathrm{Br}_{2}, \\mathrm{I}_{2}\\right.$, and $\\left.\\mathrm{At}_{2}\\right)$ form bonds like those in the chlorine molecule: one single bond between atoms and three lone pairs of electrons per atom. This allows each halogen atom to have a noble gas electron configuration. The tendency of main group atoms to form enough bonds to obtain eight valence electrons is known as the octet rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of bonds that an atom can form can often be predicted from the number of electrons needed to reach an octet (eight valence electrons); this is especially true of the nonmetals of the second period of the periodic table (C, N, O, and F). For example, each atom of a group 14 element has four electrons in its outermost shell and therefore requires four more electrons to reach an octet. These four electrons can be gained by forming four covalent bonds, as\n",
    "\n",
    "illustrated here for carbon in $\\mathrm{CCl}_{4}$ (carbon tetrachloride) and silicon in $\\mathrm{SiH}_{4}$ (silane). Because hydrogen only needs two electrons to fill its valence shell, it is an exception to the octet rule. The transition elements and inner transition elements also do not follow the octet rule:\n",
    "![Image](Chapter_7_images/img-12.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Group 15 elements such as nitrogen have five valence electrons in the atomic Lewis symbol: one lone pair and three unpaired electrons. To obtain an octet, these atoms form three covalent bonds, as in $\\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ (ammonia). Oxygen and other atoms in group 16 obtain an octet by forming two covalent bonds:\n",
    "![Image](Chapter_7_images/img-13.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Double and Triple Bonds \n",
    "\n",
    "As previously mentioned, when a pair of atoms shares one pair of electrons, we call this a single bond. However, a pair of atoms may need to share more than one pair of electrons in order to achieve the requisite octet. A double bond forms when two pairs of electrons are shared between a pair of atoms, as between the carbon and oxygen atoms in $\\mathrm{CH}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$ (formaldehyde) and between the two carbon atoms in $\\mathrm{C}_{2} \\mathrm{H}_{4}$ (ethylene):\n",
    "![Image](Chapter_7_images/img-14.jpeg)\n",

    "A triple bond forms when three electron pairs are shared by a pair of atoms, as in carbon monoxide (CO) and the cyanide ion $\\left(\\mathrm{CN}^{-}\\right)$:\n",

    "#### Writing Lewis Structures with the Octet Rule\n",

    "\n",
    "Many covalent molecules have central atoms that do not have eight electrons in their Lewis structures. These molecules fall into three categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Odd-electron molecules have an odd number of valence electrons, and therefore have an unpaired electron.\n",
    "- Electron-deficient molecules have a central atom that has fewer electrons than needed for a noble gas configuration.\n",
    "- Hypervalent molecules have a central atom that has more electrons than needed for a noble gas configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Odd-electron Molecules\n",
    "\n",
    "We call molecules that contain an odd number of electrons free radicals. Nitric oxide, NO, is an example of an oddelectron molecule; it is produced in internal combustion engines when oxygen and nitrogen react at high temperatures.\n",

    "To draw the Lewis structure for an odd-electron molecule like NO, we follow the same five steps we would for other molecules, but with a few minor changes:\n",

    "1. Determine the total number of valence (outer shell) electrons. The sum of the valence electrons is 5 (from N) +6 (from O$)=11$. The odd number immediately tells us that we have a free radical, so we know that not every atom can have eight electrons in its valence shell.\n",
    "2. Draw a skeleton structure of the molecule. We can easily draw a skeleton with an $\\mathrm{N}-\\mathrm{O}$ single bond: $\\mathrm{N}-\\mathrm{O}$\n",
    "3. Distribute the remaining electrons as lone pairs on the terminal atoms. In this case, there is no central atom, so we distribute the electrons around both atoms. We give eight electrons to the more electronegative atom in these situations; thus oxygen has the filled valence shell:\n",

To move closer to an octet for nitrogen, we take one of the lone pairs from oxygen and use it to form a NO double bond. (We cannot take another lone pair of electrons on oxygen and form a triple bond because nitrogen would then have nine electrons:)\n",

    "We will also encounter a few molecules that contain central atoms that do not have a filled valence shell. Generally, these are molecules with central atoms from groups 2 and 13, outer atoms that are hydrogen, or other atoms that do not form multiple bonds. For example, in the Lewis structures of beryllium dihydride, $\\mathrm{BeH}_{2}$, and boron trifluoride, $\\mathrm{BF}_{3}$, the beryllium and boron atoms each have only four and six electrons, respectively. It is possible to draw a structure with a double bond between a boron atom and a fluorine atom in $\\mathrm{BF}_{3}$, satisfying the octet rule, but experimental evidence indicates the bond lengths are closer to that expected for B-F single bonds. This suggests the best Lewis structure has three B-F single bonds and an electron deficient boron. The reactivity of the compound is also consistent with an electron deficient boron. However, the B-F bonds are slightly shorter than what is actually expected for B-F single bonds, indicating that some double bond character is found in the actual molecule.\n",

    "By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compute formal charges for atoms in any Lewis structure\n",
    "- Use formal charges to identify the most reasonable Lewis structure for a given molecule\n",
    "- Explain the concept of resonance and draw Lewis structures representing resonance forms for a given molecule\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous section, we discussed how to write Lewis structures for molecules and polyatomic ions. As we have seen, however, in some cases, there is seemingly more than one valid structure for a molecule. We can use the concept of formal charges to help us predict the most appropriate Lewis structure when more than one is reasonable.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Calculating Formal Charge \n",
    "\n",
    "The formal charge of an atom in a molecule is the hypothetical charge the atom would have if we could redistribute the electrons in the bonds evenly between the atoms. Another way of saying this is that formal charge results when we take the number of valence electrons of a neutral atom, subtract the nonbonding electrons, and then subtract the number of bonds connected to that atom in the Lewis structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we calculate formal charge as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text { formal charge }=\\# \\text { valence shell electrons (free atom) }-\\# \\text { lone pair electrons }-\\frac{1}{2} \\# \\text { bonding electrons }\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can double-check formal charge calculations by determining the sum of the formal charges for the whole structure. The sum of the formal charges of all atoms in a molecule must be zero; the sum of the formal charges in an ion should equal the charge of the ion.\n",
    "\n",
    "We must remember that the formal charge calculated for an atom is not the actual charge of the atom in the molecule. Formal charge is only a useful bookkeeping procedure; it does not indicate the presence of actual charges.\n",

    "#### Using Formal Charge to Predict Molecular Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The arrangement of atoms in a molecule or ion is called its molecular structure. In many cases, following the steps for writing Lewis structures may lead to more than one possible molecular structure-different multiple bond and lone-pair electron placements or different arrangements of atoms, for instance. A few guidelines involving formal charge can be helpful in deciding which of the possible structures is most likely for a particular molecule or ion:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A molecular structure in which all formal charges are zero is preferable to one in which some formal charges are not zero.\n",
    "2. If the Lewis structure must have nonzero formal charges, the arrangement with the smallest nonzero formal charges is preferable.\n",
    "3. Lewis structures are preferable when adjacent formal charges are zero or of the opposite sign.\n",
    "4. When we must choose among several Lewis structures with similar distributions of formal charges, the structure with the negative formal charges on the more electronegative atoms is preferable.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see how these guidelines apply, let us consider some possible structures for carbon dioxide, $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. We know from our previous discussion that the less electronegative atom typically occupies the central position, but formal charges allow us to understand why this occurs. We can draw three possibilities for the structure: carbon in the center and double bonds, carbon in the center with a single and triple bond, and oxygen in the center with double bonds:\n",

    "| $\\ddot{O}=\\mathrm{C}=\\ddot{\\mathrm{O}}$ | $: \\mathrm{O} \\equiv \\mathrm{C}-\\ddot{\\mathrm{O}}$ | $\\ddot{\\mathrm{O}}=\\mathrm{O}=\\ddot{\\mathrm{C}}$ | Structure |\n",

    "\n",
    "Comparing the three formal charges, we can definitively identify the structure on the left as preferable because it has only formal charges of zero (Guideline 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "As another example, the thiocyanate ion, an ion formed from a carbon atom, a nitrogen atom, and a sulfur atom, could have three different molecular structures: $\\mathrm{CNS}^{-}, \\mathrm{NCS}^{-}$, or $\\mathrm{CSN}^{-}$. The formal charges present in each of these molecular structures can help us pick the most likely arrangement of atoms. Possible Lewis structures and the formal charges for each of the three possible structures for the thiocyanate ion are shown here:\n",

    "\n",
    "Note that the sum of the formal charges in each case is equal to the charge of the ion ( -1 ). However, the first arrangement of atoms is preferred because it has the lowest number of atoms with nonzero formal charges (Guideline 2). Also, it places the least electronegative atom in the center, and the negative charge on the more electronegative element (Guideline 4).\n",

We call the individual Lewis structures resonance forms. The actual electronic structure of the molecule (the average of the resonance forms) is called a resonance hybrid of the individual resonance forms. A double-headed arrow between Lewis structures indicates that they are resonance forms. Thus, the electronic structure of the $\\mathrm{NO}_{2}{ }^{-}$ion is shown as:\n",

    "We should remember that a molecule described as a resonance hybrid never possesses an electronic structure described by either resonance form. It does not fluctuate between resonance forms; rather, the actual electronic structure is always the average of that shown by all resonance forms. George Wheland, one of the pioneers of resonance theory, used a historical analogy to describe the relationship between resonance forms and resonance hybrids. A medieval traveler, having never before seen a rhinoceros, described it as a hybrid of a dragon and a unicorn because it had many properties in common with both. Just as a rhinoceros is neither a dragon sometimes nor a unicorn at other times, a resonance hybrid is neither of its resonance forms at any given time. Like a rhinoceros, it is a real entity that experimental evidence has shown to exist. It has some characteristics in common with its resonance forms, but the resonance forms themselves are convenient, imaginary images (like the unicorn and the dragon).\n",

    "One oxygen atom must have a double bond to carbon to complete the octet on the central atom.

Because we can write three identical resonance structures, we know that the actual arrangement of electrons in the carbonate ion is the average of the three structures. Again, experiments show that all three $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ bonds are exactly the same.\n",

    "- Describe the energetics of covalent and ionic bond formation and breakage\n",
    "- Use the Born-Haber cycle to compute lattice energies for ionic compounds\n",
    "- Use average covalent bond energies to estimate enthalpies of reaction\n",
    "\n",
    "A bond's strength describes how strongly each atom is joined to another atom, and therefore how much energy is required to break the bond between the two atoms. In this section, you will learn about the bond strength of covalent bonds, and then compare that to the strength of ionic bonds, which is related to the lattice energy of a compound.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bond Strength: Covalent Bonds \n",
    "\n",
    "Stable molecules exist because covalent bonds hold the atoms together. We measure the strength of a covalent bond by the energy required to break it, that is, the energy necessary to separate the bonded atoms. Separating any pair of bonded atoms requires energy (see Figure 7.4). The stronger a bond, the greater the energy required to break it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The energy required to break a specific covalent bond in one mole of gaseous molecules is called the bond energy or the bond dissociation energy. The bond energy for a diatomic molecule, $\\mathrm{D}_{\\mathrm{X}-\\mathrm{Y}}$, is defined as the standard enthalpy change for the endothermic reaction:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathrm{XY}(g) \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{X}(g)+\\mathrm{Y}(g) \\quad \\mathrm{D}_{\\mathrm{X}-\\mathrm{Y}}=\\Delta H^{\\circ}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the bond energy of the pure covalent $\\mathrm{H}-\\mathrm{H}$ bond, $\\mathrm{D}_{\\mathrm{H}-\\mathrm{H}}$, is 436 kJ per mole of $\\mathrm{H}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds broken:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathrm{H}_{2}(g) \\longrightarrow 2 \\mathrm{H}(g) \\quad \\mathrm{D}_{\\mathrm{H}-\\mathrm{H}}=\\Delta H^{\\circ}=436 \\mathrm{~kJ}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Molecules with three or more atoms have two or more bonds. The sum of all bond energies in such a molecule is equal to the standard enthalpy change for the endothermic reaction that breaks all the bonds in the molecule. For example, the sum of the four $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bond energies in $\\mathrm{CH}_{4}, 1660 \\mathrm{~kJ}$, is equal to the standard enthalpy change of the reaction:\n",
    "![Image](Chapter_7_images/img-34.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The average $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bond energy, $\\mathrm{D}_{\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}}$, is $1660 / 4=415 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$ because there are four moles of $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds broken per mole of the reaction. Although the four $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds are equivalent in the original molecule, they do not each require the same energy to break; once the first bond is broken (which requires $439 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$ ), the remaining bonds are easier to break. The $415 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$ value is the average, not the exact value required to break any one bond.\n",
    "\n",
    "The strength of a bond between two atoms increases as the number of electron pairs in the bond increases. Generally, as the bond strength increases, the bond length decreases. Thus, we find that triple bonds are stronger and shorter than double bonds between the same two atoms; likewise, double bonds are stronger and shorter than single bonds between the same two atoms. Average bond energies for some common bonds appear in Table 7.2, and a comparison of bond lengths and bond strengths for some common bonds appears in Table 7.3. When one atom bonds to various atoms in a group, the bond strength typically decreases as we move down the group. For example, C-F is $439 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$, $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{Cl}$ is $330 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$, and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{Br}$ is $275 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n",

    "An ionic compound is stable because of the electrostatic attraction between its positive and negative ions. The lattice energy of a compound is a measure of the strength of this attraction. The lattice energy ( $\\Delta \\boldsymbol{H}_{\\text {lattice }}$ ) of an ionic compound is defined as the energy required to separate one mole of the solid into its component gaseous ions. For the ionic solid MX, the lattice energy is the enthalpy change of the process:\n",

    "\n",
    "Note that we are using the convention where the ionic solid is separated into ions, so our lattice energies will be endothermic (positive values). Some texts use the equivalent but opposite convention, defining lattice energy as the energy released when separate ions combine to form a lattice and giving negative (exothermic) values. Thus, if you are looking up lattice energies in another reference, be certain to check which definition is being used. In both cases, a larger magnitude for lattice energy indicates a more stable ionic compound. For sodium chloride, $\\Delta H_{\\text {lattice }}=769 \\mathrm{~kJ}$. Thus, it requires 769 kJ to separate one mole of solid NaCl into gaseous $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ions. When one mole each of gaseous $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ions form solid $\\mathrm{NaCl}, 769 \\mathrm{~kJ}$ of heat is released.\n",

Thus, the lattice energy of an ionic crystal increases rapidly as the charges of the ions increase and the sizes of the ions decrease. When all other\n",

In the next step, we account for the energy required to break the $\\mathrm{F}-\\mathrm{F}$ bond to produce fluorine atoms. Converting one mole of fluorine atoms into fluoride ions is an exothermic process, so this step gives off energy (the electron affinity) and is shown as decreasing along the $y$-axis. We now have one mole of Cs cations and one mole of F anions. These ions combine to produce solid cesium fluoride. The enthalpy change in this step is the negative of the lattice energy, so it is also an exothermic quantity.

A bond angle is the angle between any two bonds that include a common atom, usually measured in degrees. A bond distance (or bond length) is the distance between the nuclei of two bonded atoms along the straight line joining the nuclei. Bond distances are measured in Ångstroms (1 $\\AA=10^{-10} \\mathrm{~m}$ ) or picometers ( $\\left.1 \\mathrm{pm}=10^{-12} \\mathrm{~m}, 100 \\mathrm{pm}=1 \\AA\\right)$.\n",

    "Valence shell electron-pair repulsion theory (VSEPR theory) enables us to predict the molecular structure, including approximate bond angles around a central atom, of a molecule from an examination of the number of bonds and lone electron pairs in its Lewis structure. The VSEPR model assumes that electron pairs in the valence shell of a central atom will adopt an arrangement that minimizes repulsions between these electron pairs by maximizing the distance between them. The electrons in the valence shell of a central atom form either bonding pairs of electrons, located primarily between bonded atoms, or lone pairs. The electrostatic repulsion of these electrons is reduced when the various regions of high electron density assume positions as far from each other as possible.\n",
    "VSEPR theory predicts the arrangement of electron pairs around each central atom and, usually, the correct arrangement of atoms in a molecule. We should understand, however, that the theory only considers electron-pair repulsions. Other interactions, such as nuclear-nuclear repulsions and nuclear-electron attractions, are also involved in the final arrangement that atoms adopt in a particular molecular structure.\n",

    "As a simple example of VSEPR theory, let us predict the structure of a gaseous $\\mathrm{BeF}_{2}$ molecule. The Lewis structure of $\\mathrm{BeF}_{2}$ (Figure 7.15) shows only two electron pairs around the central beryllium atom. With two bonds and no lone pairs of electrons on the central atom, the bonds are as far apart as possible, and the electrostatic repulsion between these regions of high electron density is reduced to a minimum when they are on opposite sides of the central atom.

    "For example, the methane molecule, $\\mathrm{CH}_{4}$, which is the major component of natural gas, has four bonding pairs of electrons around the central carbon atom; the electron-pair geometry is tetrahedral, as is the molecular structure (Figure 7.17). On the other hand, the ammonia molecule, $\\mathrm{NH}_{3}$, also has four electron pairs associated with the nitrogen atom, and thus has a tetrahedral electron-pair geometry.

    "According to VSEPR theory, the terminal atom locations (Xs in Figure 7.19) are equivalent within the linear, trigonal planar, and tetrahedral electron-pair geometries (the first three rows of the table). It does not matter which X is replaced with a lone pair because the molecules can be rotated to convert positions. For trigonal bipyramidal electron-pair geometries, however, there are two distinct X positions, as shown in Figure 7.20: an axial position (if we hold a model of a trigonal bipyramid by the two axial positions, we have an axis around which we can rotate the model) and an equatorial position (three positions form an equator around the middle of the molecule). As shown in Figure 7.19, the axial position is surrounded by bond angles of $90^{\\circ}$, whereas the equatorial position has more space available because of the $120^{\\circ}$ bond angles. In a trigonal bipyramidal electron-pair geometry, lone pairs always occupy equatorial positions because these more spacious positions can more easily accommodate the larger lone pairs.\n",

If more than one arrangement of lone pairs and chemical bonds is possible, choose the one that will minimize repulsions, remembering that lone pairs occupy more space than multiple bonds, which occupy more space than single bonds. In trigonal bipyramidal arrangements, repulsion is minimized when every lone pair is in an equatorial position. In an octahedral arrangement with two lone pairs, repulsion is minimized when the lone pairs are on opposite sides of the central atom.\n",

    "As discussed previously, polar covalent bonds connect two atoms with differing electronegativities, leaving one atom with a partial positive charge $(\\delta+)$ and the other atom with a partial negative charge $(\\delta-)$, as the electrons are pulled toward the more electronegative atom. This separation of charge gives rise to a bond dipole moment. The magnitude of a bond dipole moment is represented by the Greek letter mu $(\\mu)$ and is given by the formula shown here, where Q is the magnitude of the partial charges (determined by the electronegativity difference) and $r$ is the distance between the charges:\n",

    "$$\n",

    "This bond moment can be represented as a vector, a quantity having both direction and magnitude (Figure 7.26). Dipole vectors are shown as arrows pointing along the bond from the less electronegative atom toward the more electronegative atom. A small plus sign is drawn on the less electronegative end to indicate the partially positive end of the bond. The length of the arrow is proportional to the magnitude of the electronegativity difference between the two atoms.\n",

    "Figure 7.26 (a) There is a small difference in electronegativity between $C$ and $H$, represented as a short vector. (b) The electronegativity difference between $B$ and $F$ is much larger, so the vector representing the bond moment is much longer.\n",
    "\n",
    "A whole molecule may also have a separation of charge, depending on its molecular structure and the polarity of each of its bonds. If such a charge separation exists, the molecule is said to be a polar molecule (or dipole); otherwise the molecule is said to be nonpolar. The dipole moment measures the extent of net charge separation in the molecule as a whole. We determine the dipole moment by adding the bond moments in three-dimensional space, taking into account the molecular structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "For diatomic molecules, there is only one bond, so its bond dipole moment determines the molecular polarity. Homonuclear diatomic molecules such as $\\mathrm{Br}_{2}$ and $\\mathrm{N}_{2}$ have no difference in electronegativity, so their dipole moment is zero. For heteronuclear molecules such as CO, there is a small dipole moment. For HF, there is a larger dipole moment because there is a larger difference in electronegativity.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a molecule contains more than one bond, the geometry must be taken into account. If the bonds in a molecule are arranged such that their bond moments cancel (vector sum equals zero), then the molecule is nonpolar. This is the situation in $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ (Figure 7.27). Each of the bonds is polar, but the molecule as a whole is nonpolar. From the Lewis structure, and using VSEPR theory, we determine that the $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ molecule is linear with polar $\\mathrm{C}=\\mathrm{O}$ bonds on opposite sides of the carbon atom. The bond moments cancel because they are pointed in opposite directions. In the case of the water molecule (Figure 7.27), the Lewis structure again shows that there are two bonds to a central atom, and the electronegativity difference again shows that each of these bonds has a nonzero bond moment. In this case, however, the molecular structure is bent because of the lone pairs on O , and the two bond moments do not cancel. Therefore, water does have a net dipole moment and is a polar molecule (dipole).\n",

The bond moments will be maximized when the electronegativity difference is greatest. The controls for A and C should be set to one extreme, and B should be set to the opposite extreme.

    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7.1 Ionic Bonding\n",
    "\n",
    "Atoms gain or lose electrons to form ions with particularly stable electron configurations. The charges of cations formed by the representative metals may be determined readily because, with few exceptions, the electronic structures of these ions have either a noble gas configuration or a completely filled electron shell. The charges of anions formed by the nonmetals may also be readily determined because these ions form when nonmetal atoms gain enough electrons to fill their valence shells.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7.2 Covalent Bonding\n",
    "\n",
    "Covalent bonds form when electrons are shared between atoms and are attracted by the nuclei of both atoms. In pure covalent bonds, the electrons are shared equally. In polar covalent bonds, the electrons are shared unequally, as one atom exerts a stronger force of attraction on the electrons than the other. The ability of an atom to attract a pair of electrons in a chemical bond is called its electronegativity. The difference in electronegativity between two atoms determines how polar a bond will be. In a diatomic molecule with two identical atoms, there is no difference in electronegativity, so the bond is nonpolar or pure covalent. When the electronegativity difference is very large, as is the case between metals and nonmetals, the bonding is characterized as ionic.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7.3 Lewis Symbols and Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "Valence electronic structures can be visualized by drawing Lewis symbols (for atoms and monatomic ions) and Lewis structures (for molecules and polyatomic ions). Lone pairs, unpaired electrons, and single, double, or triple bonds are used to indicate where the valence electrons are located around each atom in a Lewis structure. Most structures-especially those containing second row elements-obey the octet rule, in which every atom (except H) is surrounded by eight electrons. Exceptions to the octet rule occur for odd-electron molecules (free radicals), electrondeficient molecules, and hypervalent molecules.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7.4 Formal Charges and Resonance\n",
    "\n",
    "In a Lewis structure, formal charges can be assigned to each atom by treating each bond as if one-half of the electrons are assigned to each atom. These hypothetical formal charges are a guide to determining the most appropriate Lewis structure. A structure in which the formal charges are as close to zero as possible is preferred. Resonance occurs in cases where two or more Lewis structures with identical arrangements of atoms but different distributions of electrons can be written. The actual distribution of electrons (the resonance hybrid) is an average of the distribution indicated by the individual Lewis structures (the resonance forms).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7.5 Strengths of Ionic and Covalent Bonds\n",
    "\n",
    "The strength of a covalent bond is measured by its bond dissociation energy, that is, the amount of energy required to break that particular bond in a mole of molecules. Multiple bonds are stronger than single bonds between the same atoms. The enthalpy of a reaction can be estimated based on the energy input required to break bonds and the energy released when new bonds are formed. For ionic bonds, the lattice energy is the energy required to separate one mole of a compound into its gas phase ions. Lattice energy increases for ions with higher charges and shorter distances between ions. Lattice energies are often calculated using the Born-Haber cycle, a thermochemical cycle including all\n",
    "\n",
    "of the energetic steps involved in converting elements into an ionic compound.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7.6 Molecular Structure and Polarity \n",
    "\n",
    "VSEPR theory predicts the three-dimensional arrangement of atoms in a molecule. It states that valence electrons will assume an electron-pair geometry that minimizes repulsions between areas of high electron density (bonds and/ or lone pairs). Molecular structure, which refers only to the placement of atoms in a molecule and not the electrons, is equivalent to electron-pair geometry only when there are no lone electron pairs around the central atom. A dipole moment measures a separation of charge. For one bond, the bond dipole moment is determined by the difference in electronegativity between the two atoms. For a molecule, the overall dipole moment is determined by both the individual bond moments and how these dipoles are arranged in the molecular structure. Polar molecules (those with an appreciable dipole moment) interact with electric fields, whereas nonpolar molecules do not.\n",
