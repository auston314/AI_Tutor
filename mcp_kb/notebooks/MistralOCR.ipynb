      "\n",
      "Real-world machine learning deployments are characterized by mismatches between the source (training) and target (test) distributions that may cause performance drops. In this work, we investigate methods for predicting the target domain accuracy using only labeled source data and unlabeled target data. We propose Average Thresholded Confidence (ATC), a practical method that learns a threshold on the model's confidence, predicting accuracy as the fraction of unlabeled examples for which model confidence exceeds that threshold. ATC outperforms previous methods across several model architectures, types of distribution shifts (e.g., due to synthetic corruptions, dataset reproduction, or novel subpopulations), and datasets (WILDS, ImageNet, BREEDS, CIFAR, and MNIST). In our experiments, ATC estimates target performance $2-4 \\times$ more accurately than prior methods. We also explore the theoretical foundations of the problem, proving that, in general, identifying the accuracy is just as hard as identifying the optimal predictor and thus, the efficacy of any method rests upon (perhaps unstated) assumptions on the nature of the shift. Finally, analyzing our method on some toy distributions, we provide insights concerning when it works ${ }^{1}$.\n",

      "Machine learning models deployed in the real world typically encounter examples from previously unseen distributions. While the IID assumption enables us to evaluate models using held-out data from the source distribution (from which training data is sampled), this estimate is no longer valid in presence of a distribution shift. Moreover, under such shifts, model accuracy tends to degrade (Szegedy et al., 2014; Recht et al., 2019; Koh et al., 2021). Commonly, the only data available to the practitioner are a labeled training set (source) and unlabeled deployment-time data which makes the problem more difficult. In this setting, detecting shifts in the distribution of covariates is known to be possible (but difficult) in theory (Ramdas et al., 2015), and in practice (Rabanser et al., 2018). However, producing an optimal predictor using only labeled source and unlabeled target data is well-known to be impossible absent further assumptions (Ben-David et al., 2010; Lipton et al., 2018).\n",
      "\n",
      "Two vital questions that remain are: (i) the precise conditions under which we can estimate a classifier's target-domain accuracy; and (ii) which methods are most practically useful. To begin, the straightforward way to assess the performance of a model under distribution shift would be to collect labeled (target domain) examples and then to evaluate the model on that data. However, collecting fresh labeled data from the target distribution is prohibitively expensive and time-consuming, especially if the target distribution is non-stationary. Hence, instead of using labeled data, we aim to use unlabeled data from the target distribution, that is comparatively abundant, to predict model performance. Note that in this work, our focus is not to improve performance on the target but, rather, to estimate the accuracy on the target for a given classifier.\n",

      "Figure 1: Illustration of our proposed method ATC. Left: using source domain validation data, we identify a threshold on a score (e.g. negative entropy) computed on model confidence such that fraction of examples above the threshold matches the validation set accuracy. ATC estimates accuracy on unlabeled target data as the fraction of examples with the score above the threshold. Interestingly, this threshold yields accurate estimates on a wide set of target distributions resulting from natural and synthetic shifts. Right: Efficacy of ATC over previously proposed approaches on our testbed with a post-hoc calibrated model. To obtain errors on the same scale, we rescale all errors with Average Confidence (AC) error. Lower estimation error is better. See Table 1 for exact numbers and comparison on various types of distribution shift. See Sec. 5 for details on our testbed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recently, numerous methods have been proposed for this purpose (Deng & Zheng, 2021; Chen et al., 2021b; Jiang et al., 2021; Deng et al., 2021; Guillory et al., 2021). These methods either require calibration on the target domain to yield consistent estimates (Jiang et al., 2021; Guillory et al., 2021) or additional labeled data from several target domains to learn a linear regression function on a distributional distance that then predicts model performance (Deng et al., 2021; Deng & Zheng, 2021; Guillory et al., 2021). However, methods that require calibration on the target domain typically yield poor estimates since deep models trained and calibrated on source data are not, in general, calibrated on a (previously unseen) target domain (Ovadia et al., 2019). Besides, methods that leverage labeled data from target domains rely on the fact that unseen target domains exhibit strong linear correlation with seen target domains on the underlying distance measure and, hence, can be rendered ineffective when such target domains with labeled data are unavailable (in Sec. 5.1 we demonstrate such a failure on a real-world distribution shift problem). Therefore, throughout the paper, we assume access to labeled source data and only unlabeled data from target domain(s).\n",
      "\n",
      "In this work, we first show that absent assumptions on the source classifier or the nature of the shift, no method of estimating accuracy will work generally (even in non-contrived settings). To estimate accuracy on target domain perfectly, we highlight that even given perfect knowledge of the labeled source distribution (i.e., $p_{s}(x, y)$) and unlabeled target distribution (i.e., $p_{t}(x)$), we need restrictions on the nature of the shift such that we can uniquely identify the target conditional $p_{t}(y | x)$. Thus, in general, identifying the accuracy of the classifier is as hard as identifying the optimal predictor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, motivated by the superiority of methods that use maximum softmax probability (or logit) of a model for Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) detection (Hendrycks & Gimpel, 2016; Hendrycks et al., 2019), we propose a simple method that leverages softmax probability to predict model performance. Our method, Average Thresholded Confidence (ATC), learns a threshold on a score (e.g., maximum confidence or negative entropy) of model confidence on validation source data and predicts target domain accuracy as the fraction of unlabeled target points that receive a score above that threshold. ATC selects a threshold on validation source data such that the fraction of source examples that receive the score above the threshold match the accuracy of those examples. Our primary contribution in ATC is the proposal of obtaining the threshold and observing its efficacy on (practical) accuracy estimation. Importantly, our work takes a step forward in positively answering the question raised in Deng & Zheng (2021); Deng et al. (2021) about a practical strategy to select a threshold that enables accuracy prediction with thresholded model confidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "ATC is simple to implement with existing frameworks, compatible with arbitrary model classes, and dominates other contemporary methods. Across several model architectures on a range of benchmark vision and language datasets, we verify that ATC outperforms prior methods by at least $2-4 \\times$ in predicting target accuracy on a variety of distribution shifts. In particular, we consider shifts due to common corruptions (e.g., ImageNet-C), natural distribution shifts due to dataset reproduction (e.g., ImageNet-v2, ImageNet-R), shifts due to novel subpopulations (e.g., BREEDS), and distribution shifts faced in the wild (e.g., WILDS).\n",
      "\n",
      "As a starting point for theory development, we investigate ATC on a simple toy model that models distribution shift with varying proportions of the population with spurious features, as in Nagarajan et al. (2020). Finally, we note that although ATC achieves superior performance in our empirical evaluation, like all methods, it must fail (returns inconsistent estimates) on certain types of distribution shifts, per our impossibility result.\n",

      "Out-of-distribution detection. The main goal of OOD detection is to identify previously unseen examples, i.e., samples out of the support of training distribution. To accomplish this, modern methods utilize confidence or features learned by a deep network trained on some source data. Hendrycks \\& Gimpel (2016); Geifman \\& El-Yaniv (2017) used the confidence score of an (already) trained deep model to identify OOD points. Lakshminarayanan et al. (2016) use entropy of an ensemble model to evaluate prediction uncertainty on OOD points. To improve OOD detection with model confidence, Liang et al. (2017) propose to use temperature scaling and input perturbations. Jiang et al. (2018) propose to use scores based on the relative distance of the predicted class to the second class. Recently, residual flow-based methods were used to obtain a density model for OOD detection (Zhang et al., 2020). Ji et al. (2021) proposed a method based on subfunction error bounds to compute unreliability per sample. Refer to Ovadia et al. (2019); Ji et al. (2021) for an overview and comparison of methods for prediction uncertainty on OOD data.\n",

      "Predicting model generalization. Understanding generalization capabilities of overparameterized models on in-distribution data using conventional machine learning tools has been a focus of a long line of work; representative research includes Neyshabur et al. (2015; 2017); Neyshabur (2017); Neyshabur et al. (2018); Dziugaite \\& Roy (2017); Bartlett et al. (2017); Zhou et al. (2018); Long \\& Sedghi (2019); Nagarajan \\& Kolter (2019a). At a high level, this line of research bounds the generalization gap directly with complexity measures calculated on the trained model. However, these bounds typically remain numerically loose relative to the true generalization error (Zhang et al., 2016; Nagarajan \\& Kolter, 2019b). On the other hand, another line of research departs from complexitybased approaches to use unseen unlabeled data to predict in-distribution generalization (Platanios et al., 2016; 2017; Garg et al., 2021; Jiang et al., 2021).\n",
      "\n",
      "Relevant to our work are methods for predicting the error of a classifier on OOD data based on unlabeled data from the target (OOD) domain. These methods can be characterized into two broad categories: (i) Methods which explicitly predict correctness of the model on individual unlabeled points (Deng \\& Zheng, 2021; Jiang et al., 2021; Deng et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2021a); and (ii) Methods which directly obtain an estimate of error with unlabeled OOD data without making a point-wise prediction (Chen et al., 2021b; Guillory et al., 2021; Chuang et al., 2020).\n",
      "\n",
      "To achieve a consistent estimate of the target accuracy, Jiang et al. (2021); Guillory et al. (2021) require calibration on target domain. However, these methods typically yield poor estimates as deep models trained and calibrated on some source data are seldom calibrated on previously unseen domains (Ovadia et al., 2019). Additionally, Deng \\& Zheng (2021); Guillory et al. (2021) derive model-based distribution statistics on unlabeled target set that correlate with the target accuracy and propose to use a subset of labeled target domains to learn a (linear) regression function that predicts model performance. However, there are two drawbacks with this approach: (i) the correlation of these distribution statistics can vary substantially as we consider different nature of shifts (refer to Sec. 5.1, where we empirically demonstrate this failure); (ii) even if there exists a (hypothetical) statistic with strong correlations, obtaining labeled target domains (even simulated ones) with strong correlations would require significant a priori knowledge about the nature of shift that, in general, might not be available before models are deployed in the wild. Nonetheless, in our work, we only assume access to labeled data from the source domain presuming no access to labeled target domains or information about how to simulate them.\n",

      "Moreover, unlike the parallel work of Deng et al. (2021), we do not focus on methods that alter the training on source data to aid accuracy prediction on the target data. Chen et al. (2021b) propose an importance re-weighting based approach that leverages (additional) information about the axis along which distribution is shifting in form of “slicing functions”. In our work, we make comparisons with importance re-weighting baseline from Chen et al. (2021b) as we do not have any additional information about the axis along which the distribution is shifting.\n",

      "### 3.1 Accuracy Estimation: Possibility and Impossibility Results\n",
      "\n",
      "First, we investigate the question of when it is possible to estimate the target accuracy of an arbitrary classifier, even given knowledge of the full source distribution $p_{s}(x, y)$ and target marginal $p_{t}(x)$. Absent assumptions on the nature of shift, estimating target accuracy is impossible. Even given access to $p_{s}(x, y)$ and $p_{t}(x)$, the problem is fundamentally unidentifiable because $p_{t}(y \\mid x)$ can shift arbitrarily. In the following proposition, we show that absent assumptions on the classifier $f$ (i.e., when $f$ can be any classifier in the space of all classifiers on $\\mathcal{X}$ ), we can estimate accuracy on the target data iff assumptions on the nature of the shift, together with $p_{s}(x, y)$ and $p_{t}(x)$, uniquely identify the (unknown) target conditional $p_{t}(y \\mid x)$. We relegate proofs from this section to App. A.\n",
      "Proposition 1. Absent further assumptions, accuracy on the target is identifiable iff $p_{t}(y \\mid x)$ is uniquely identified given $p_{s}(x, y)$ and $p_{t}(x)$.\n",
      "\n",
      "Proposition 1 states that we need enough constraints on nature of shift such that $p_{s}(x, y)$ and $p_{t}(x)$ identifies unique $p_{t}(y \\mid x)$. It also states that under some assumptions on the nature of the shift, we can hope to estimate the model's accuracy on target data. We will illustrate this on two common assumptions made in domain adaptation literature: (i) covariate shift (Heckman, 1977; Shimodaira, 2000) and (ii) label shift (Saerens et al., 2002; Zhang et al., 2013; Lipton et al., 2018). Under covariate shift assumption, that the target marginal support $\\operatorname{supp}\\left(p_{t}(x)\\right)$ is a subset of the source marginal support $\\operatorname{supp}\\left(p_{s}(x)\\right)$ and that the conditional distribution of labels given inputs does not change within support, i.e., $p_{s}(y \\mid x)=p_{t}(y \\mid x)$, which, trivially, identifies a unique target conditional $p_{t}(y \\mid x)$. Under label shift, the reverse holds, i.e., the class-conditional distribution does not change $\\left(p_{s}(x \\mid y)=p_{t}(x \\mid y)\\right)$ and, again, information about $p_{t}(x)$ uniquely determines the target conditional $p_{t}(y \\mid x)$ (Lipton et al., 2018; Garg et al., 2020). In these settings, one can estimate an arbitrary classifier's accuracy on the target domain either by using importance re-weighting with the ratio $p_{t}(x) / p_{s}(x)$ in case of covariate shift or by using importance re-weighting with the ratio $p_{t}(y) / p_{s}(y)$ in case of label shift. While importance ratios in the former case can be obtained directly when $p_{t}(x)$ and $p_{s}(x)$ are known, the importance ratios in the latter case can be obtained by using techniques from Saerens et al. (2002); Lipton et al. (2018); Azizzadenesheli et al. (2019); Alexandari et al. (2019). In App. B,we explore accuracy estimation in the setting of these shifts and present extensions to generalized notions of label shift (Tachet des Combes et al., 2020) and covariate shift (Rojas-Carulla et al., 2018).\n",

For illustration, consider a setting where we have access to distribution $p_{s}(x, y)$ and $p_{t}(x)$. Additionally, assume that the distribution can shift only due to covariate shift or label shift without any knowledge about which one. Then Corollary 1 says that it is impossible to have a single method that will simultaneously for both label shift and covariate shift as in the following example (we spell out the details in App. A):\n",

Thus, given access to $p_{s}(x, y)$, and $p_{t}(x)$, any method that consistently estimates error of a classifer under covariate shift will give an incorrect estimate of error under label shift and vice-versa. The reason is that the same $p_{t}(x)$ and $p_{s}(x, y)$ can correspond to error $\\mathcal{E}_{1}$ (under covariate shift) or error $\\mathcal{E}_{2}$ (under label shift) and determining which scenario one faces requires further assumptions on the nature of shift.\n",

      "We predict accuracy on the target data before and after calibration with TS. First, we observe that both ATC-NE and ATC-MC (even without TS) obtain significantly lower MAE when compared with other methods (even with TS). Note that with TS we observe substantial improvements in MAE for all methods. Overall, ATC-NE (with TS) typically achieves the smallest MAE improving by more than $2 \\times$ on CIFAR and by $3-4 \\times$ on ImageNet over GDE (the next best alternative to ATC). Alongside, we also observe that a linear fit with robust regression (Siegel, 1982) on the scatter plot recovers a line close to $x=y$ for ATC-NE with TS while the line is far away from $x=y$ for other methods (Fig. 2 and Fig. 1(right)). Remarkably, MAE is in the range of $0.4-5.8$ with ATC for CIFAR, ImageNet, MNIST, and Wilds. However, MAE is much higher on BREEDS benchmark with novel subpopulations. While we observe a small MAE (i.e., comparable to our observations on other datasets) on BREEDS with natural and synthetic shifts from the same sub-population, MAE on shifts with novel population is significantly higher with all methods.

Corroborating this intuition, next, we show that even after fitting a regression model for DOC on natural and synthetic shifts with source subpopulations, ATC without regression model continues to outperform DOC with regression model on shifts with novel subpopulation.\n",

      "\n",
      "In this section, we propose and analyze a simple theoretical model that distills empirical phenomena from the previous section and highlights efficacy of ATC. Here, our aim is not to obtain a general model that captures complicated real distributions on high dimensional input space as the images in ImageNet. Instead to further our understanding, we focus on an easy-to-learn binary classification task from Nagarajan et al. (2020) with linear classifiers, that is rich enough to exhibit some of the same phenomena as with deep networks on real data distributions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consider a easy-to-learn binary classification problem with two features $x=\\left[x_{\\text {inv }}, x_{\\text {sp }}\\right] \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ where $x_{\\text {inv }}$ is fully predictive invariant feature with a margin $\\gamma>0$ and $x_{\\text {sp }} \\in\\{-1,1\\}$ is a spurious feature (i.e., a feature that is correlated but not predictive of the true label). Conditional on $y$, the distribution over $x_{\\text {inv }}$ is given as follows: $x_{\\text {inv }}|(y=1) \\sim U[\\gamma, c]$ and $x_{\\text {inv }}|(y=0) \\sim U[-c,-\\gamma]$, where $c$ is a fixed constant greater than $\\gamma$. For simplicity, we assume that label distribution on source is uniform on $\\{-1,1\\} . x_{\\text {sp }}$ is distributed such that $P_{s}\\left[x_{\\text {sp }} \\cdot(2 y-1)>0\\right]=p_{\\text {sp }}$, where $p_{\\text {sp }} \\in(0.5,1.0)$ controls the degree of spurious correlation. To model distribution shift, we simulate target data with different degree of spurious correlation, i.e., in target distribution $P_{t}\\left[x_{\\text {sp }} \\cdot(2 y-1)>0\\right]=p_{\\text {sp }}^{\\prime} \\in[0,1]$. Note that here we do not consider shifts in the label distribution but our result extends to arbitrary shifts in the label distribution as well.\n",

      "In this setup, we examine linear sigmoid classifiers of the form $f(x)=\\left[\\frac{1}{1+e^{w^{T} x}}, \\frac{e^{w^{T} x}}{1+e^{w^{T} x}}\\right]$ where $w=\\left[w_{\\text {inv }}, w_{\\text {sp }}\\right] \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$. While there exists a linear classifier with $w=[1,0]$ that correctly classifies all the points with a margin $\\gamma$, Nagarajan et al. (2020) demonstrated that a linear classifier will typically have a dependency on the spurious feature, i.e., $w_{\\text {sp }} \\neq 0$. They show that due to geometric skews, despite having positive dependencies on the invariant feature, a max-margin classifier trained on finite samples relies on the spurious feature. Refer to App. D for more details on these skews. In our work, we show that given a linear classifier that relies on the spurious feature and achieves a non-trivial performance on the source (i.e., $w_{\\text {inv }}>0$ ), ATC with maximum confidence score function consistently estimates the accuracy on the target distribution.\n",
      "Theorem 1 (Informal). Given any classifier with $w_{\\text {inv }}>0$ in the above setting, the threshold obtained in (1) together with ATC as in (2) with maximum confidence score function obtains a consistent estimate of the target accuracy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consider a classifier that depends positively on the spurious feature (i.e., $w_{\\text {sp }}>0$ ). Then as the spurious correlation decreases in the target data, the classifier accuracy on the target will drop and vice-versa if the spurious correlation increases on the target data. Theorem 1 shows that the threshold identified with ATC as in (1) remains invariant as the distribution shifts and hence ATC as in (2) will correctly estimate the accuracy with shifting distributions. Next, we illustrate Theorem 1 by simulating the setup empirically. First we pick a arbitrary classifier (which can also be obtained by training on source samples), tune the threshold on hold-out source examples and predict accuracy with different methods as we shift the distribution by varying the degree of spurious correlation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Empirical validation and comparison with other methods. Fig. 3(right) shows that as the degree of spurious correlation varies, our method accurately estimates the target performance where all other methods fail to accurately estimate the target performance. Understandably, due to poor calibration of the sigmoid linear classifier AC, DOC and GDE fail. While in principle IM can perfectly estimate the accuracy on target in this case, we observe that it is highly sensitive to the number bins and choice of histogram binning (i.e., uniform mass or equal width binning). We elaborate more on this in App. D.\n",

We assumed that both in source and target $x_{\\text {inv }}|y=1$ is uniform between $[\\gamma, c]$ and $x \\mid y=-1$ is uniform between $[-c,-\\gamma]$. Shifting the support of target class conditional $p_{t}\\left(x_{\\text {inv }} \\mid y\\right)$ may introduce a bias in ATC estimates, e.g., shrinking the support to $c_{1}(<c)$ (while maintaining uniform distribution) in the target will lead to an over-estimation of the target performance with ATC. In App. D.1, we elaborate on this failure and present a general (but less interpretable) classifier dependent distribution shift condition where ATC is guaranteed to yield consistent estimates.\n",

      "# 7 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK \n",
      "\n",
      "In this work, we proposed ATC, a simple method for estimating target domain accuracy based on unlabeled target (and labeled source data). ATC achieves remarkably low estimation error on several synthetic and natural shift benchmarks in our experiments. Notably, our work draws inspiration from recent state-of-the-art methods that use softmax confidences below a certain threshold for OOD detection (Hendrycks \\& Gimpel, 2016; Hendrycks et al., 2019) and takes a step forward in answering questions raised in Deng \\& Zheng (2021) about the practicality of threshold based methods.\n",
      "Our distribution shift toy model justifies ATC on an easy-to-learn binary classification task. In our experiments, we also observe that calibration significantly improves estimation with ATC. Since in binary classification, post hoc calibration with TS does not change the effective threshold, in future work, we hope to extend our theoretical model to multi-class classification to understand the efficacy\n",
      "\n",
      "of calibration. Our theory establishes that a classifier's accuracy is not, in general identified, from labeled source and unlabeled target data alone, absent considerable additional constraints on the target conditional $p_{t}(y \\mid x)$. In light of this finding, we also hope to extend our understanding beyond the simple theoretical toy model to characterize broader sets of conditions under which ATC might be guaranteed to obtain consistent estimates. Finally, we should note that while ATC outperforms previous approaches, it still suffers from large estimation error on datasets with novel populations, e.g., BreEDS. We hope that our findings can lay the groundwork for future work for improving accuracy estimation on such datasets.\n",

      "Our method can be interpreted as identifying examples for correct and incorrect prediction based on the value of the score function $s(f(x))$, i.e., if the score $s(f(x))$ is greater than or equal to the threshold $t$ then our method predicts that the classifier correctly predicted datum $(x, y)$ and vice-versa if the score is less than $t$. A method that can solve this task will perfectly estimate the target performance. However, such an expectation is unrealistic. Instead, ATC expects that most of the examples with score above threshold are correct and most of the examples below the threshold are incorrect. More importantly, ATC selects a threshold such that the number of falsely identified correct predictions match falsely identified incorrect predictions on source distribution, thereby balancing incorrect predictions. We expect useful estimates of accuracy with ATC if the threshold transfers to target, i.e. if the number of falsely identified correct predictions match falsely identified incorrect predictions on target. This interpretation relates our method to the OOD detection literature where Hendrycks \\& Gimpel (2016); Hendrycks et al. (2019) highlight that classifiers tend to assign higher confidence to in-distribution examples and leverage maximum softmax confidence (or logit) to perform OOD detection.\n",

      "Skews observed in this toy model In Fig. 4, we illustrate the toy model used in our empirical experiment. In the same setup, we empirically observe that the margin on population with less density is large, i.e., margin is much greater than $\\gamma$ when the number of observed samples is small (in Fig. 4 (d)). Building on this observation, Nagarajan et al. (2020) showed in cases when margin decreases with number of samples, a max margin classifier trained on finite samples is bound to depend on the spurious features in such cases. They referred to this skew as geometric skew.\n",

      "Moreover, even when the number of samples are large so that we do not observe geometric skews, Nagarajan et al. (2020) showed that training for finite number of epochs, a linear classifier will have a non zero dependency on the spurious feature. They referred to this skew as statistical skew. Due both of these skews, we observe that a linear classifier obtained with training for finite steps on training data with finite samples, will have a non-zero dependency on the spurious feature. We refer interested reader to Nagarajan et al. (2020) for more details.\n",

In particular, we consider 3 ImageNetv2 (Recht et al., 2019) datasets each using a different strategy to collect test sets. We also evaluate performance on images with artistic renditions of object classes, i.e., ImageNet-R (Hendrycks et al., 2021) and ImageNet-Sketch (Wang et al., 2019) with hand drawn sketch images. Note that renditions dataset only contains 200 classes from ImageNet. Hence, in the main paper we include results on ImageNet restricted to these 200 classes, which we call as ImageNet-200, and relegate results on ImageNet with 1 k classes to appendix.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also consider BreEDS benchmark (Santurkar et al., 2020) in our evaluation to assess robustness to subpopulation shifts, in particular, to understand how accuracy estimation methods behave when novel subpopulations not observed during training are introduced. BreEDS leverages class hierarchy in ImageNet to repurpose original classes to be the subpopulations and defines a classification task on superclasses. Subpopulation shift is induced by directly making the subpopulations present in the training and test distributions disjoint. Overall, BreEDS benchmark contains 4 datasets EnTiTy-13, EnTiTy-30, Living-17, Non-Living-26, each focusing on different subtrees in the hierarchy. To generate BreEDS dataset on top of ImageNet, we use the open source library: https : //github.com/MadryLab/BREEDS-Benchmarks. We focus on natural and synthetic shifts as in ImageNet on same and different subpopulations in BREEDs. Thus for both the subpopulation (same or novel), we obtain a total of 99 target datasets.\n",

      "CIFAR setup. Similar to the ImageNet setup, we consider (i) synthetic shifts (CIFAR-10-C) due to common corruptions; and (ii) natural distribution shift (i.e., CIFARv2 (Recht et al., 2018; Torralba et al., 2008)) due to differences in data collection strategy on on CIFAR-10 (Krizhevsky \\& Hinton, 2009). On CIFAR-100, we just have synthetic shifts due to common corruptions.\n",

For multiclass problems, ATC-NE and ATC-MC can lead to different ordering of examples when ranked with the corresponding scoring function. Temperature scaling on top can further alter the ordering of examples. The changed ordering of examples yields different thresholds and different accuracy estimates. However for binary classification, the two scoring functions are the same as entropy (i.e. $p \\log (p)+(1-p) \\log (p))$ has a one-to-one mapping to the max conf for $p \\in[0,1]$. Moreover, temperature scaling also doesn't change the order of points for binary classification problems.

    "Your alarm goes off and, after hitting \"snooze\" once or twice, you pry yourself out of bed. You make a cup of coffee to help you get going, and then you shower, get dressed, eat breakfast, and check your phone for messages. On your way to school, you stop to fill your car's gas tank, almost making you late for the first day of chemistry class. As you find a seat in the classroom, you read the question projected on the screen: \"Welcome to class! Why should we study chemistry?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Do you have an answer? You may be studying chemistry because it fulfills an academic requirement, but if you consider your daily activities, you might find chemistry interesting for other reasons. Most everything you do and encounter during your day involves chemistry. Making coffee, cooking eggs, and toasting bread involve chemistry. The products you use-like soap and shampoo, the fabrics you wear, the electronics that keep you connected to your world, the gasoline that propels your car-all of these and more involve chemical substances and processes. Whether you are aware or not, chemistry is part of your everyday world. In this course, you will learn many of the essential principles underlying the chemistry of modern-day life.\n",

    "Throughout human history, people have tried to convert matter into more useful forms. Our Stone Age ancestors chipped pieces of flint into useful tools and carved wood into statues and toys. These endeavors involved changing the shape of a substance without changing the substance itself. But as our knowledge increased, humans began to change the composition of the substances as well-clay was converted into pottery, hides were cured to make garments, copper ores were transformed into copper tools and weapons, and grain was made into bread.\n",
    "Humans began to practice chemistry when they learned to control fire and use it to cook, make pottery, and smelt metals. Subsequently, they began to separate and use specific components of matter. A variety of drugs such as aloe, myrrh, and opium were isolated from plants. Dyes, such as indigo and Tyrian purple, were extracted from plant and animal matter. Metals were combined to form alloys-for example, copper and tin were mixed together to make bronze-and more elaborate smelting techniques produced iron. Alkalis were extracted from ashes, and soaps were prepared by combining these alkalis with fats. Alcohol was produced by fermentation and purified by distillation.\n",
    "Attempts to understand the behavior of matter extend back for more than 2500 years. As early as the sixth century BC, Greek philosophers discussed a system in which water was the basis of all things. You may have heard of the Greek postulate that matter consists of four elements: earth, air, fire, and water. Subsequently, an amalgamation of chemical technologies and philosophical speculations was spread from Egypt, China, and the eastern Mediterranean by alchemists, who endeavored to transform \"base metals\" such as lead into \"noble metals\" like gold, and to create elixirs to cure disease and extend life (Figure 1.2).\n",

    "\n",
    "From alchemy came the historical progressions that led to modern chemistry: the isolation of drugs from natural sources, metallurgy, and the dye industry. Today, chemistry continues to deepen our understanding and improve our ability to harness and control the behavior of matter.\n",

    "# Chemistry: The Central Science \n",
    "\n",
    "Chemistry is sometimes referred to as \"the central science\" due to its interconnectedness with a vast array of other STEM disciplines (STEM stands for areas of study in the science, technology, engineering, and math fields). Chemistry and the language of chemists play vital roles in biology, medicine, materials science, forensics, environmental science, and many other fields (Figure 1.3). The basic principles of physics are essential for understanding many aspects of chemistry, and there is extensive overlap between many subdisciplines within the two fields, such as chemical physics and nuclear chemistry. Mathematics, computer science, and information theory provide important tools that help us calculate, interpret, describe, and generally make sense of the chemical world. Biology and chemistry converge in biochemistry, which is crucial to understanding the many complex factors and processes that keep living organisms (such as us) alive. Chemical engineering, materials science, and nanotechnology combine chemical principles and empirical findings to produce useful substances, ranging from gasoline to fabrics to electronics. Agriculture, food science, veterinary science, and brewing and wine making help provide sustenance in the form of food and drink to the world's population. Medicine, pharmacology, biotechnology, and botany identify and produce substances that help keep us healthy. Environmental science, geology, oceanography, and atmospheric science incorporate many chemical ideas to help us better understand and protect our physical world. Chemical ideas are used to help understand the universe in astronomy and cosmology.\n",

    "Figure 1.3 Knowledge of chemistry is central to understanding a wide range of scientific disciplines. This diagram shows just some of the interrelationships between chemistry and other fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "What are some changes in matter that are essential to daily life? Digesting and assimilating food, synthesizing polymers that are used to make clothing, containers, cookware, and credit cards, and refining crude oil into gasoline and other products are just a few examples. As you proceed through this course, you will discover many different examples of changes in the composition and structure of matter, how to classify these changes and how they occurred, their causes, the changes in energy that accompany them, and the principles and laws involved. As you learn about these things, you will be learning chemistry, the study of the composition, properties, and interactions of matter. The practice of chemistry is not limited to chemistry books or laboratories: It happens whenever someone is involved in changes in matter or in conditions that may lead to such changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The Scientific Method \n",
    "\n",
    "Chemistry is a science based on observation and experimentation. Doing chemistry involves attempting to answer questions and explain observations in terms of the laws and theories of chemistry, using procedures that are accepted by the scientific community. There is no single route to answering a question or explaining an observation, but there is an aspect common to every approach: Each uses knowledge based on experiments that can be reproduced to verify the results. Some routes involve a hypothesis, a tentative explanation of observations that acts as a guide for gathering and checking information. A hypothesis is tested by experimentation, calculation, and/or comparison with the experiments of others and then refined as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some hypotheses are attempts to explain the behavior that is summarized in laws. The laws of science summarize a vast number of experimental observations, and describe or predict some facet of the natural world. If such a hypothesis turns out to be capable of explaining a large body of experimental data, it can reach the status of a theory. Scientific theories are well-substantiated, comprehensive, testable explanations of particular aspects of nature. Theories are accepted because they provide satisfactory explanations, but they can be modified if new data become available. The path of discovery that leads from question and observation to law or hypothesis to theory, combined with experimental verification of the hypothesis and any necessary modification of the theory, is called the scientific method (Figure 1.4).\n",
    "\n",
    "![Image](Chapter_1_images/img-3.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 1.4 The scientific method follows a process similar to the one shown in this diagram. All the key components are shown, in roughly the right order. Scientific progress is seldom neat and clean: It requires open inquiry and the reworking of questions and ideas in response to findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The Domains of Chemistry \n",
    "\n",
    "Chemists study and describe the behavior of matter and energy in three different domains: macroscopic, microscopic, and symbolic. These domains provide different ways of considering and describing chemical behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Macro is a Greek word that means \"large.\" The macroscopic domain is familiar to us: It is the realm of everyday things that are large enough to be sensed directly by human sight or touch. In daily life, this includes the food you eat and the breeze you feel on your face. The macroscopic domain includes everyday and laboratory chemistry, where we observe and measure physical and chemical properties such as density, solubility, and flammability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Micro comes from Greek and means \"small.\" The microscopic domain of chemistry is often visited in the imagination. Some aspects of the microscopic domain are visible through standard optical microscopes, for example, many biological cells. More sophisticated instruments are capable of imaging even smaller entities such as molecules and atoms (see Figure $1.5(\\mathbf{b})$ ).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, most of the subjects in the microscopic domain of chemistry are too small to be seen even with the most advanced microscopes and may only be pictured in the mind. Other components of the microscopic domain include ions and electrons, protons and neutrons, and chemical bonds, each of which is far too small to see.\n",
    "\n",
    "The symbolic domain contains the specialized language used to represent components of the macroscopic and microscopic domains. Chemical symbols (such as those used in the periodic table), chemical formulas, and chemical equations are part of the symbolic domain, as are graphs, drawings, and calculations. These symbols play an important role in chemistry because they help interpret the behavior of the macroscopic domain in terms of the components of the microscopic domain. One of the challenges for students learning chemistry is recognizing that the same symbols can represent different things in the macroscopic and microscopic domains, and one of the features that makes chemistry fascinating is the use of a domain that must be imagined to explain behavior in a domain that can be observed.\n",
    "\n",
    "A helpful way to understand the three domains is via the essential and ubiquitous substance of water. That water is a liquid at moderate temperatures, will freeze to form a solid at lower temperatures, and boil to form a gas at higher temperatures (Figure 1.5) are macroscopic observations. But some properties of water fall into the microscopic domain-what cannot be observed with the naked eye. The description of water as comprising two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, and the explanation of freezing and boiling in terms of attractions between these molecules, is within the microscopic arena. The formula $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$, which can describe water at either the macroscopic or microscopic levels, is an example of the symbolic domain. The abbreviations $(g)$ for gas, $(s)$ for solid, and $(l)$ for liquid are also symbolic.\n",
    "![Image](Chapter_1_images/img-4.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 1.5 (a) Moisture in the air, icebergs, and the ocean represent water in the macroscopic domain. (b) At the molecular level (microscopic domain), gas molecules are far apart and disorganized, solid water molecules are close together and organized, and liquid molecules are close together and disorganized. (c) The formula $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$ symbolizes water, and $(g),(s)$, and $(l)$ symbolize its phases. Note that clouds actually comprise either very small liquid water droplets or solid water crystals; gaseous water in our atmosphere is not visible to the naked eye, although it may be sensed as humidity.

    "# 1.2 Phases and Classification of Matter \n",

    "\n",
    "- Describe the basic properties of each physical state of matter: solid, liquid, and gas\n",
    "- Distinguish between mass and weight\n",
    "- Apply the law of conservation of matter\n",
    "- Classify matter as an element, compound, homogeneous mixture, or heterogeneous mixture with regard to its physical state and composition\n",
    "- Define and give examples of atoms and molecules\n",
    "\n",
    "Matter is defined as anything that occupies space and has mass, and it is all around us. Solids and liquids are more obviously matter: We can see that they take up space, and their weight tells us that they have mass. Gases are also\n",
    "\n",
    "matter; if gases did not take up space, a balloon would not inflate (increase its volume) when filled with gas.\n",
    "Solids, liquids, and gases are the three states of matter commonly found on earth (Figure 1.6). A solid is rigid and possesses a definite shape. A liquid flows and takes the shape of its container, except that it forms a flat or slightly curved upper surface when acted upon by gravity. (In zero gravity, liquids assume a spherical shape.) Both liquid and solid samples have volumes that are very nearly independent of pressure. A gas takes both the shape and volume of its container.\n",

    "\n",
    "Figure 1.6 The three most common states or phases of matter are solid, liquid, and gas.\n",
    "\n",
    "A fourth state of matter, plasma, occurs naturally in the interiors of stars. A plasma is a gaseous state of matter that contains appreciable numbers of electrically charged particles (Figure 1.7). The presence of these charged particles imparts unique properties to plasmas that justify their classification as a state of matter distinct from gases. In addition to stars, plasmas are found in some other high-temperature environments (both natural and man-made), such as lightning strikes, certain television screens, and specialized analytical instruments used to detect trace amounts of metals.\n",

    "Some samples of matter appear to have properties of solids, liquids, and/or gases at the same time. This can occur when the sample is composed of many small pieces. For example, we can pour sand as if it were a liquid because it is composed of many small grains of solid sand. Matter can also have properties of more than one state when it is a mixture, such as with clouds. Clouds appear to behave somewhat like gases, but they are actually mixtures of air (gas) and tiny particles of water (liquid or solid).\n",

But her weight on the moon is only one-sixth her earth-bound weight because the moon's gravity is only one-sixth that of the earth's.

    "# Classifying Matter \n",
    "\n",
    "Matter can be classified into several categories. Two broad categories are mixtures and pure substances. A pure substance has a constant composition. All specimens of a pure substance have exactly the same makeup and properties. Any sample of sucrose (table sugar) consists of $42.1 \\%$ carbon, $6.5 \\%$ hydrogen, and $51.4 \\%$ oxygen by mass. Any sample of sucrose also has the same physical properties, such as melting point, color, and sweetness, regardless of the source from which it is isolated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pure substances may be divided into two classes: elements and compounds. Pure substances that cannot be broken down into simpler substances by chemical changes are called elements. Iron, silver, gold, aluminum, sulfur, oxygen, and copper are familiar examples of the more than 100 known elements, of which about 90 occur naturally on the earth, and two dozen or so have been created in laboratories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pure substances that can be broken down by chemical changes are called compounds. This breakdown may produce either elements or other compounds, or both. Mercury(II) oxide, an orange, crystalline solid, can be broken down by heat into the elements mercury and oxygen (Figure 1.9). When heated in the absence of air, the compound sucrose is broken down into the element carbon and the compound water. (The initial stage of this process, when the sugar is turning brown, is known as caramelization-this is what imparts the characteristic sweet and nutty flavor to caramel apples, caramelized onions, and caramel). Silver(I) chloride is a white solid that can be broken down into its elements, silver and chlorine, by absorption of light. This property is the basis for the use of this compound in photographic\n",

    "\n",
    "The properties of combined elements are different from those in the free, or uncombined, state. For example, white crystalline sugar (sucrose) is a compound resulting from the chemical combination of the element carbon, which is a black solid in one of its uncombined forms, and the two elements hydrogen and oxygen, which are colorless gases when uncombined. Free sodium, an element that is a soft, shiny, metallic solid, and free chlorine, an element that is a yellow-green gas, combine to form sodium chloride (table salt), a compound that is a white, crystalline solid.\n",
    "\n",
    "A mixture is composed of two or more types of matter that can be present in varying amounts and can be separated by physical changes, such as evaporation (you will learn more about this later). A mixture with a composition that varies from point to point is called a heterogeneous mixture. Italian dressing is an example of a heterogeneous mixture (Figure 1.10). Its composition can vary because it may be prepared from varying amounts of oil, vinegar, and herbs. It is not the same from point to point throughout the mixture-one drop may be mostly vinegar, whereas a different drop may be mostly oil or herbs because the oil and vinegar separate and the herbs settle. Other examples of heterogeneous mixtures are chocolate chip cookies (we can see the separate bits of chocolate, nuts, and cookie dough) and granite (we can see the quartz, mica, feldspar, and more).\n",

    "A homogeneous mixture, also called a solution, exhibits a uniform composition and appears visually the same throughout. An example of a solution is a sports drink, consisting of water, sugar, coloring, flavoring, and electrolytes mixed together uniformly (Figure 1.10). Each drop of a sports drink tastes the same because each drop contains the same amounts of water, sugar, and other components. Note that the composition of a sports drink can vary-it could be made with somewhat more or less sugar, flavoring, or other components, and still be a sports drink. Other examples of homogeneous mixtures include air, maple syrup, gasoline, and a solution of salt in water.\n",

    "Your alarm goes off and, after hitting \"snooze\" once or twice, you pry yourself out of bed. You make a cup of coffee to help you get going, and then you shower, get dressed, eat breakfast, and check your phone for messages. On your way to school, you stop to fill your car's gas tank, almost making you late for the first day of chemistry class. As you find a seat in the classroom, you read the question projected on the screen: \"Welcome to class! Why should we study chemistry?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Do you have an answer? You may be studying chemistry because it fulfills an academic requirement, but if you consider your daily activities, you might find chemistry interesting for other reasons. Most everything you do and encounter during your day involves chemistry. Making coffee, cooking eggs, and toasting bread involve chemistry. The products you use-like soap and shampoo, the fabrics you wear, the electronics that keep you connected to your world, the gasoline that propels your car-all of these and more involve chemical substances and processes. Whether you are aware or not, chemistry is part of your everyday world. In this course, you will learn many of the essential principles underlying the chemistry of modern-day life.\n",

    "Throughout human history, people have tried to convert matter into more useful forms. Our Stone Age ancestors chipped pieces of flint into useful tools and carved wood into statues and toys. These endeavors involved changing the shape of a substance without changing the substance itself. But as our knowledge increased, humans began to change the composition of the substances as well-clay was converted into pottery, hides were cured to make garments, copper ores were transformed into copper tools and weapons, and grain was made into bread.\n",
    "Humans began to practice chemistry when they learned to control fire and use it to cook, make pottery, and smelt metals. Subsequently, they began to separate and use specific components of matter. A variety of drugs such as aloe, myrrh, and opium were isolated from plants. Dyes, such as indigo and Tyrian purple, were extracted from plant and animal matter. Metals were combined to form alloys-for example, copper and tin were mixed together to make bronze-and more elaborate smelting techniques produced iron. Alkalis were extracted from ashes, and soaps were prepared by combining these alkalis with fats. Alcohol was produced by fermentation and purified by distillation.\n",
    "Attempts to understand the behavior of matter extend back for more than 2500 years. As early as the sixth century BC, Greek philosophers discussed a system in which water was the basis of all things. You may have heard of the Greek postulate that matter consists of four elements: earth, air, fire, and water. Subsequently, an amalgamation of chemical technologies and philosophical speculations was spread from Egypt, China, and the eastern Mediterranean by alchemists, who endeavored to transform \"base metals\" such as lead into \"noble metals\" like gold, and to create elixirs to cure disease and extend life (Figure 1.2).\n",

    "# Chemistry: The Central Science \n",
    "\n",
    "Chemistry is sometimes referred to as \"the central science\" due to its interconnectedness with a vast array of other STEM disciplines (STEM stands for areas of study in the science, technology, engineering, and math fields). Chemistry and the language of chemists play vital roles in biology, medicine, materials science, forensics, environmental science, and many other fields (Figure 1.3). The basic principles of physics are essential for understanding many aspects of chemistry, and there is extensive overlap between many subdisciplines within the two fields, such as chemical physics and nuclear chemistry. Mathematics, computer science, and information theory provide important tools that help us calculate, interpret, describe, and generally make sense of the chemical world. Biology and chemistry converge in biochemistry, which is crucial to understanding the many complex factors and processes that keep living organisms (such as us) alive. Chemical engineering, materials science, and nanotechnology combine chemical principles and empirical findings to produce useful substances, ranging from gasoline to fabrics to electronics. Agriculture, food science, veterinary science, and brewing and wine making help provide sustenance in the form of food and drink to the world's population. Medicine, pharmacology, biotechnology, and botany identify and produce substances that help keep us healthy. Environmental science, geology, oceanography, and atmospheric science incorporate many chemical ideas to help us better understand and protect our physical world. Chemical ideas are used to help understand the universe in astronomy and cosmology.\n",

    "Figure 1.3 Knowledge of chemistry is central to understanding a wide range of scientific disciplines. This diagram shows just some of the interrelationships between chemistry and other fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "What are some changes in matter that are essential to daily life? Digesting and assimilating food, synthesizing polymers that are used to make clothing, containers, cookware, and credit cards, and refining crude oil into gasoline and other products are just a few examples. As you proceed through this course, you will discover many different examples of changes in the composition and structure of matter, how to classify these changes and how they occurred, their causes, the changes in energy that accompany them, and the principles and laws involved. As you learn about these things, you will be learning chemistry, the study of the composition, properties, and interactions of matter. The practice of chemistry is not limited to chemistry books or laboratories: It happens whenever someone is involved in changes in matter or in conditions that may lead to such changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The Scientific Method \n",
    "\n",
    "Chemistry is a science based on observation and experimentation. Doing chemistry involves attempting to answer questions and explain observations in terms of the laws and theories of chemistry, using procedures that are accepted by the scientific community. There is no single route to answering a question or explaining an observation, but there is an aspect common to every approach: Each uses knowledge based on experiments that can be reproduced to verify the results. Some routes involve a hypothesis, a tentative explanation of observations that acts as a guide for gathering and checking information. A hypothesis is tested by experimentation, calculation, and/or comparison with the experiments of others and then refined as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some hypotheses are attempts to explain the behavior that is summarized in laws. The laws of science summarize a vast number of experimental observations, and describe or predict some facet of the natural world. If such a hypothesis turns out to be capable of explaining a large body of experimental data, it can reach the status of a theory. Scientific theories are well-substantiated, comprehensive, testable explanations of particular aspects of nature. Theories are accepted because they provide satisfactory explanations, but they can be modified if new data become available. The path of discovery that leads from question and observation to law or hypothesis to theory, combined with experimental verification of the hypothesis and any necessary modification of the theory, is called the scientific method (Figure 1.4).\n",
    "\n",
    "![Image](Chapter_1_images/img-3.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 1.4 The scientific method follows a process similar to the one shown in this diagram. All the key components are shown, in roughly the right order. Scientific progress is seldom neat and clean: It requires open inquiry and the reworking of questions and ideas in response to findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The Domains of Chemistry \n",
    "\n",
    "Chemists study and describe the behavior of matter and energy in three different domains: macroscopic, microscopic, and symbolic. These domains provide different ways of considering and describing chemical behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Macro is a Greek word that means \"large.\" The macroscopic domain is familiar to us: It is the realm of everyday things that are large enough to be sensed directly by human sight or touch. In daily life, this includes the food you eat and the breeze you feel on your face. The macroscopic domain includes everyday and laboratory chemistry, where we observe and measure physical and chemical properties such as density, solubility, and flammability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Micro comes from Greek and means \"small.\" The microscopic domain of chemistry is often visited in the imagination. Some aspects of the microscopic domain are visible through standard optical microscopes, for example, many biological cells. More sophisticated instruments are capable of imaging even smaller entities such as molecules and atoms (see Figure $1.5(\\mathbf{b})$ ).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, most of the subjects in the microscopic domain of chemistry are too small to be seen even with the most advanced microscopes and may only be pictured in the mind. Other components of the microscopic domain include ions and electrons, protons and neutrons, and chemical bonds, each of which is far too small to see.\n",
    "\n",
    "The symbolic domain contains the specialized language used to represent components of the macroscopic and microscopic domains. Chemical symbols (such as those used in the periodic table), chemical formulas, and chemical equations are part of the symbolic domain, as are graphs, drawings, and calculations. These symbols play an important role in chemistry because they help interpret the behavior of the macroscopic domain in terms of the components of the microscopic domain. One of the challenges for students learning chemistry is recognizing that the same symbols can represent different things in the macroscopic and microscopic domains, and one of the features that makes chemistry fascinating is the use of a domain that must be imagined to explain behavior in a domain that can be observed.\n",
    "\n",
    "A helpful way to understand the three domains is via the essential and ubiquitous substance of water. That water is a liquid at moderate temperatures, will freeze to form a solid at lower temperatures, and boil to form a gas at higher temperatures (Figure 1.5) are macroscopic observations. But some properties of water fall into the microscopic domain-what cannot be observed with the naked eye. The description of water as comprising two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, and the explanation of freezing and boiling in terms of attractions between these molecules, is within the microscopic arena. The formula $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$, which can describe water at either the macroscopic or microscopic levels, is an example of the symbolic domain. The abbreviations $(g)$ for gas, $(s)$ for solid, and $(l)$ for liquid are also symbolic.\n",
    "![Image](Chapter_1_images/img-4.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 1.5 (a) Moisture in the air, icebergs, and the ocean represent water in the macroscopic domain. (b) At the molecular level (microscopic domain), gas molecules are far apart and disorganized, solid water molecules are close together and organized, and liquid molecules are close together and disorganized. (c) The formula $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$ symbolizes water, and $(g),(s)$, and $(l)$ symbolize its phases. Note that clouds actually comprise either very small liquid water droplets or solid water crystals; gaseous water in our atmosphere is not visible to the naked eye, although it may be sensed as humidity.

A liquid flows and takes the shape of its container, except that it forms a flat or slightly curved upper surface when acted upon by gravity. (In zero gravity, liquids assume a spherical shape.)

The presence of these charged particles imparts unique properties to plasmas that justify their classification as a state of matter distinct from gases. In addition to stars, plasmas are found in some other high-temperature environments (both natural and man-made), such as lightning strikes, certain television screens, and specialized analytical instruments used to detect trace amounts of metals.\n",

(The initial stage of this process, when the sugar is turning brown, is known as caramelization-this is what imparts the characteristic sweet and nutty flavor to caramel apples, caramelized onions, and caramel). Silver(I) chloride is a white solid that can be broken down into its elements, silver and chlorine, by absorption of light. This property is the basis for the use of this compound in photographic\n",

    "The properties of combined elements are different from those in the free, or uncombined, state. For example, white crystalline sugar (sucrose) is a compound resulting from the chemical combination of the element carbon, which is a black solid in one of its uncombined forms, and the two elements hydrogen and oxygen, which are colorless gases when uncombined. Free sodium, an element that is a soft, shiny, metallic solid, and free chlorine, an element that is a yellow-green gas, combine to form sodium chloride (table salt), a compound that is a white, crystalline solid.\n",

    "A mixture is composed of two or more types of matter that can be present in varying amounts and can be separated by physical changes, such as evaporation (you will learn more about this later). A mixture with a composition that varies from point to point is called a heterogeneous mixture. Italian dressing is an example of a heterogeneous mixture (Figure 1.10). Its composition can vary because it may be prepared from varying amounts of oil, vinegar, and herbs. It is not the same from point to point throughout the mixture-one drop may be mostly vinegar, whereas a different drop may be mostly oil or herbs because the oil and vinegar separate and the herbs settle. Other examples of heterogeneous mixtures are chocolate chip cookies (we can see the separate bits of chocolate, nuts, and cookie dough) and granite (we can see the quartz, mica, feldspar, and more).\n",

An example of a solution is a sports drink, consisting of water, sugar, coloring, flavoring, and electrolytes mixed together uniformly (Figure 1.10). Each drop of a sports drink tastes the same because each drop contains the same amounts of water, sugar, and other components. Note that the composition of a sports drink can vary-it could be made with somewhat more or less sugar, flavoring, or other components, and still be a sports drink. Other examples of homogeneous mixtures include air, maple syrup, gasoline, and a solution of salt in water.\n",

Imagine cutting a gold nugget in half, then cutting one of the halves in half, and repeating this process until a piece of gold remained that was so small that it could not be cut in half (regardless of how tiny your knife may be). This minimally sized piece of gold is an atom (from the Greek atomos, meaning \"indivisible\") (Figure 1.12). This atom would no longer be gold if it were divided any further.\n",

    "The first suggestion that matter is composed of atoms is attributed to the Greek philosophers Leucippus and Democritus, who developed their ideas in the 5th century BCE. However, it was not until the early nineteenth century that John Dalton (1766-1844), a British schoolteacher with a keen interest in science, supported this hypothesis with quantitative measurements. Since that time, repeated experiments have confirmed many aspects of this hypothesis, and it has become one of the central theories of chemistry. Other aspects of Dalton's atomic theory are still used but with minor revisions (details of Dalton's theory are provided in the chapter on atoms and molecules).\n",

    "An atom is so small that its size is difficult to imagine. One of the smallest things we can see with our unaided eye is a single thread of a spider web: These strands are about $1 / 10,000$ of a centimeter $(0.0001 \\mathrm{~cm})$ in diameter. Although the cross-section of one strand is almost impossible to see without a microscope, it is huge on an atomic scale. A single carbon atom in the web has a diameter of about 0.000000015 centimeter, and it would take about 7000 carbon atoms to span the diameter of the strand. To put this in perspective, if a carbon atom were the size of a dime, the cross-section of one strand would be larger than a football field, which would require about 150 million carbon atom \"dimes\" to cover it.

It would require over $300,000,000,000,000$ lead atoms ( 300 trillion, or $3 \\times 10^{14}$ ) to be weighed, and they would weigh only 0.0000001 gram.\n",

    "It is rare to find collections of individual atoms. Only a few elements, such as the gases helium, neon, and argon, consist of a collection of individual atoms that move about independently of one another. Other elements, such as the gases hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, and chlorine, are composed of units that consist of pairs of atoms (Figure 1.14). One form of the element phosphorus consists of units composed of four phosphorus atoms. The element sulfur exists in various forms, one of which consists of units composed of eight sulfur atoms. These units are called molecules. A molecule consists of two or more atoms joined by strong forces called chemical bonds. The atoms in a molecule move around as a unit, much like the cans of soda in a six-pack or a bunch of keys joined together on a single key ring. A molecule may consist of two or more identical atoms, as in the molecules found in the elements hydrogen, oxygen, and sulfur, or it may consist of two or more different atoms, as in the molecules found in water. Each water molecule is a unit that contains two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. Each glucose molecule is a unit that contains 6 carbon atoms, 12 hydrogen atoms, and 6 oxygen atoms. Like atoms, molecules are incredibly small and light. If an ordinary glass of water were enlarged to the size of the earth, the water molecules inside it would be about the size of golf balls.\n",

    "The two gases produced have distinctly different properties. Oxygen is not flammable but is required for combustion of a fuel, and hydrogen is highly flammable and a potent energy source. How might this knowledge be applied in our world? One application involves research into more fuel-efficient transportation. Fuel-cell vehicles (FCV) run on hydrogen instead of gasoline (Figure 1.16). They are more efficient than vehicles with internal combustion engines, are nonpolluting, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, making us less dependent on fossil fuels. FCVs are not yet economically viable, however, and current hydrogen production depends on natural gas. If we can develop a process to economically decompose water, or produce hydrogen in another environmentally sound way, FCVs may be the way of the future.\n",

The display screen is made from a specially toughened glass (silica glass strengthened by the addition of aluminum, sodium, and potassium) and coated with a material to make it conductive (such as indium tin oxide). The circuit board uses a semiconductor material (usually silicon); commonly used metals like copper, tin, silver, and gold; and more unfamiliar elements such as yttrium, praseodymium, and gadolinium.

    "The characteristics that distinguish one substance from another are called properties. A physical property is a characteristic of matter that is not associated with a change in its chemical composition. Familiar examples of physical properties include density, color, hardness, melting and boiling points, and electrical conductivity. Some physical properties, such as density and color, may be observed without changing the physical state of the matter. Other physical properties, such as the melting temperature of iron or the freezing temperature of water, can only be observed as matter undergoes a physical change. A physical change is a change in the state or properties of matter without any accompanying change in the chemical identities of the substances contained in the matter. Physical changes are observed when wax melts, when sugar dissolves in coffee, and when steam condenses into liquid water (Figure 1.18). Other examples of physical changes include magnetizing and demagnetizing metals (as is done with common antitheft security tags) and grinding solids into powders (which can sometimes yield noticeable changes in color). In each of these examples, there is a change in the physical state, form, or properties of the substance, but no change in its chemical composition.\n",

    "Properties of matter fall into one of two categories. If the property depends on the amount of matter present, it is an extensive property. The mass and volume of a substance are examples of extensive properties; for instance, a gallon of milk has a larger mass than a cup of milk. The value of an extensive property is directly proportional to the amount of matter in question. If the property of a sample of matter does not depend on the amount of matter present, it is an intensive property. Temperature is an example of an intensive property. If the gallon and cup of milk are each at $20^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ (room temperature), when they are combined, the temperature remains at $20^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$. As another example, consider the distinct but related properties of heat and temperature. A drop of hot cooking oil spattered on your arm causes brief, minor discomfort, whereas a pot of hot oil yields severe burns. Both the drop and the pot of oil are at the same temperature (an intensive property), but the pot clearly contains much more heat (extensive property).\n",

Every measurement provides three kinds of information: the size or magnitude of the measurement (a number); a standard of comparison for the measurement (a unit); and an indication of the uncertainty of the measurement. While the number and unit are explicitly represented when a quantity is written, the uncertainty is an aspect of the measurement result that is more implicitly represented and will be discussed later.\n",

    "## SI Base Units\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial units of the metric system, which eventually evolved into the SI system, were established in France during the French Revolution. The original standards for the meter and the kilogram were adopted there in 1799 and eventually by other countries. This section introduces four of the SI base units commonly used in chemistry. Other SI units will be introduced in subsequent chapters.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Length\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard unit of length in both the SI and original metric systems is the meter (m). A meter was originally specified as $1 / 10,000,000$ of the distance from the North Pole to the equator. It is now defined as the distance light in a vacuum travels in $1 / 299,792,458$ of a second. A meter is about 3 inches longer than a yard (Figure 1.23); one meter is about 39.37 inches or 1.094 yards. Longer distances are often reported in kilometers ( $1 \\mathrm{~km}=1000 \\mathrm{~m}=10^{3}$ m ), whereas shorter distances can be reported in centimeters $\\left(1 \\mathrm{~cm}=0.01 \\mathrm{~m}=10^{-2} \\mathrm{~m}\\right)$ or millimeters $(1 \\mathrm{~mm}=0.001$ $\\mathrm{m}=10^{-3} \\mathrm{~m}$ ).\n",

    "\n",
    "# Mass \n",
    "\n",
    "The standard unit of mass in the SI system is the kilogram (kg). A kilogram was originally defined as the mass of a liter of water (a cube of water with an edge length of exactly 0.1 meter). It is now defined by a certain cylinder of platinum-iridium alloy, which is kept in France (Figure 1.24). Any object with the same mass as this cylinder is said to have a mass of 1 kilogram. One kilogram is about 2.2 pounds. The gram $(\\mathrm{g})$ is exactly equal to $1 / 1000$ of the mass of the kilogram $\\left(10^{-3} \\mathrm{~kg}\\right)$.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Temperature\n",
    "\n",
    "Temperature is an intensive property. The SI unit of temperature is the kelvin (K). The IUPAC convention is to use kelvin (all lowercase) for the word, K (uppercase) for the unit symbol, and neither the word \"degree\" nor the degree\n",
    "\n",
    "symbol $\\left({ }^{\\circ}\\right)$. The degree Celsius $\\left({ }^{\\circ} \\mathbf{C}\\right)$ is also allowed in the SI system, with both the word \"degree\" and the degree symbol used for Celsius measurements. Celsius degrees are the same magnitude as those of kelvin, but the two scales place their zeros in different places. Water freezes at $273.15 \\mathrm{~K}\\left(0^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}\\right)$ and boils at $373.15 \\mathrm{~K}\\left(100^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}\\right)$ by definition, and normal human body temperature is approximately $310 \\mathrm{~K}\\left(37^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}\\right)$. The conversion between these two units and the Fahrenheit scale will be discussed later in this chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Time \n",
    "\n",
    "The SI base unit of time is the second (s). Small and large time intervals can be expressed with the appropriate prefixes; for example, 3 microseconds $=0.000003 \\mathrm{~s}=3 \\times 10^{-6}$ and 5 megaseconds $=5,000,000 \\mathrm{~s}=5 \\times 10^{6} \\mathrm{~s}$. Alternatively, hours, days, and years can be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Derived SI Units\n",
    "\n",
    "We can derive many units from the seven SI base units. For example, we can use the base unit of length to define a unit of volume, and the base units of mass and length to define a unit of density.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Volume\n",
    "\n",
    "Volume is the measure of the amount of space occupied by an object. The standard SI unit of volume is defined by the base unit of length (Figure 1.25). The standard volume is a cubic meter $\\left(\\mathbf{m}^{\\mathbf{3}}\\right)$, a cube with an edge length of exactly one meter. To dispense a cubic meter of water, we could build a cubic box with edge lengths of exactly one meter. This box would hold a cubic meter of water or any other substance.\n",
    "\n",
    "A more commonly used unit of volume is derived from the decimeter ( 0.1 m , or 10 cm ). A cube with edge lengths of exactly one decimeter contains a volume of one cubic decimeter $\\left(\\mathrm{dm}^{3}\\right)$. A liter ( $\\mathbf{L}$ ) is the more common name for the cubic decimeter. One liter is about 1.06 quarts.\n",
    "\n",
    "A cubic centimeter $\\left(\\mathbf{c m}^{\\mathbf{3}}\\right)$ is the volume of a cube with an edge length of exactly one centimeter. The abbreviation cc (for cubic centimeter) is often used by health professionals. A cubic centimeter is equivalent to a milliliter (mL) and is $1 / 1000$ of a liter.\n",

(b) The diameter of a dime is compared relative to the edge length of a $1-\\mathrm{cm}^{3}(1-\\mathrm{mL})$ cube.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Density \n",
    "\n",
    "We use the mass and volume of a substance to determine its density. Thus, the units of density are defined by the base units of mass and length.\n",
    "\n",
    "The density of a substance is the ratio of the mass of a sample of the substance to its volume. The SI unit for density is the kilogram per cubic meter $\\left(\\mathrm{kg} / \\mathrm{m}^{3}\\right)$. For many situations, however, this as an inconvenient unit, and we often use grams per cubic centimeter $\\left(\\mathrm{g} / \\mathrm{cm}^{3}\\right)$ for the densities of solids and liquids, and grams per liter $(\\mathrm{g} / \\mathrm{L})$ for gases. Although there are exceptions, most liquids and solids have densities that range from about $0.7 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ (the density of gasoline) to $19 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ (the density of gold). The density of air is about $1.2 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{L}$. Table 1.4 shows the densities of some common substances.\n",

    "### 1.5 Measurement Uncertainty, Accuracy, and Precision\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Define accuracy and precision\n",
    "- Distinguish exact and uncertain numbers\n",
    "- Correctly represent uncertainty in quantities using significant figures\n",
    "- Apply proper rounding rules to computed quantities\n",
    "\n",
    "Counting is the only type of measurement that is free from uncertainty, provided the number of objects being counted does not change while the counting process is underway. The result of such a counting measurement is an example of an exact number. By counting the eggs in a carton, one can determine exactly how many eggs the carton contains. The numbers of defined quantities are also exact. By definition, 1 foot is exactly 12 inches, 1 inch is exactly 2.54 centimeters, and 1 gram is exactly 0.001 kilogram. Quantities derived from measurements other than counting, however, are uncertain to varying extents due to practical limitations of the measurement process used.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Significant Figures in Measurement\n",
    "\n",
    "The numbers of measured quantities, unlike defined or directly counted quantities, are not exact. To measure the volume of liquid in a graduated cylinder, you should make a reading at the bottom of the meniscus, the lowest point on the curved surface of the liquid.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Image](Chapter_1_images/img-27.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 1.26 To measure the volume of liquid in this graduated cylinder, you must mentally subdivide the distance between the 21 and 22 mL marks into tenths of a milliliter, and then make a reading (estimate) at the bottom of the meniscus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Refer to the illustration in Figure 1.26. The bottom of the meniscus in this case clearly lies between the 21 and 22 markings, meaning the liquid volume is certainly greater than 21 mL but less than 22 mL . The meniscus appears to be a bit closer to the $22-\\mathrm{mL}$ mark than to the $21-\\mathrm{mL}$ mark, and so a reasonable estimate of the liquid's volume would be 21.6 mL . In the number 21.6, then, the digits 2 and 1 are certain, but the 6 is an estimate. Some people might estimate the meniscus position to be equally distant from each of the markings and estimate the tenth-place digit as 5 , while others may think it to be even closer to the $22-\\mathrm{mL}$ mark and estimate this digit to be 7 . Note that it would be pointless to attempt to estimate a digit for the hundredths place, given that the tenths-place digit is uncertain. In general, numerical scales such as the one on this graduated cylinder will permit measurements to one-tenth of the smallest scale division. The scale in this case has $1-\\mathrm{mL}$ divisions, and so volumes may be measured to the nearest 0.1 mL .\n",
    "\n",
    "This concept holds true for all measurements, even if you do not actively make an estimate. If you place a quarter on a standard electronic balance, you may obtain a reading of 6.72 g . The digits 6 and 7 are certain, and the 2 indicates that the mass of the quarter is likely between 6.71 and 6.73 grams. The quarter weighs about 6.72 grams, with a nominal uncertainty in the measurement of $\\pm 0.01$ gram. If the coin is weighed on a more sensitive balance, the mass might be 6.723 g . This means its mass lies between 6.722 and 6.724 grams, an uncertainty of 0.001 gram. Every measurement has some uncertainty, which depends on the device used (and the user's ability). All of the digits in a measurement, including the uncertain last digit, are called significant figures or significant digits. Note that zero may be a measured value; for example, if you stand on a scale that shows weight to the nearest pound and it shows \"120,\" then the 1 (hundreds), 2 (tens) and 0 (ones) are all significant (measured) values.\n",
    "A measurement result is properly reported when its significant digits accurately represent the certainty of the measurement process. But what if you were analyzing a reported value and trying to determine what is significant and what is not? Well, for starters, all nonzero digits are significant, and it is only zeros that require some thought. We will use the terms \"leading,\" \"trailing,\" and \"captive\" for the zeros and will consider how to deal with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Image](Chapter_1_images/img-28.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting with the first nonzero digit on the left, count this digit and all remaining digits to the right. This is the number of significant figures in the measurement unless the last digit is a trailing zero lying to the left of the decimal point.\n",
    "![Image](Chapter_1_images/img-29.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Captive zeros result from measurement and are therefore always significant. Leading zeros, however, are never significant-they merely tell us where the decimal point is located.\n",
    "![Image](Chapter_1_images/img-30.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The leading zeros in this example are not significant. We could use exponential notation (as described in Appendix B) and express the number as $8.32407 \\times 10^{-3}$; then the number 8.32407 contains all of the significant figures, and $10^{-3}$ locates the decimal point.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of significant figures is uncertain in a number that ends with a zero to the left of the decimal point location. The zeros in the measurement 1,300 grams could be significant or they could simply indicate where the decimal point is located. The ambiguity can be resolved with the use of exponential notation: $1.3 \\times 10^{3}$ (two significant figures), $1.30 \\times 10^{3}$ (three significant figures, if the tens place was measured), or $1.300 \\times 10^{3}$ (four significant figures, if the ones place was also measured). In cases where only the decimal-formatted number is available, it is prudent to assume that all trailing zeros are not significant.\n",
    "![Image](Chapter_1_images/img-31.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "When determining significant figures, be sure to pay attention to reported values and think about the measurement and significant figures in terms of what is reasonable or likely when evaluating whether the value makes sense. For example, the official January 2014 census reported the resident population of the US as $317,297,725$. Do you think the US population was correctly determined to the reported nine significant figures, that is, to the exact number of people? People are constantly being born, dying, or moving into or out of the country, and assumptions are made to account for the large number of people who are not actually counted. Because of these uncertainties, it might be more reasonable to expect that we know the population to within perhaps a million or so, in which case the population should be reported as $3.17 \\times 10^{8}$ people.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Significant Figures in Calculations \n",
    "\n",
    "A second important principle of uncertainty is that results calculated from a measurement are at least as uncertain as\n",
    "\n",
    "the measurement itself. Take the uncertainty in measurements into account to avoid misrepresenting the uncertainty in calculated results. One way to do this is to report the result of a calculation with the correct number of significant figures, which is determined by the following three rules for rounding numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. When adding or subtracting numbers, round the result to the same number of decimal places as the number with the least number of decimal places (the least certain value in terms of addition and subtraction).\n",
    "2. When multiplying or dividing numbers, round the result to the same number of digits as the number with the least number of significant figures (the least certain value in terms of multiplication and division).\n",
    "3. If the digit to be dropped (the one immediately to the right of the digit to be retained) is less than 5, \"round down\" and leave the retained digit unchanged; if it is more than 5, \"round up\" and increase the retained digit by 1 ; if the dropped digit is 5 , round up or down, whichever yields an even value for the retained digit. (The last part of this rule may strike you as a bit odd, but it's based on reliable statistics and is aimed at avoiding any bias when dropping the digit \" 5 ,\" since it is equally close to both possible values of the retained digit.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The following examples illustrate the application of this rule in rounding a few different numbers to three significant figures:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 0.028675 rounds \"up\" to 0.0287 (the dropped digit, 7, is greater than 5)\n",
    "- 18.3384 rounds \"down\" to 18.3 (the dropped digit, 3, is less than 5)\n",
    "- 6.8752 rounds \"up\" to 6.88 (the dropped digit is 5 , and the retained digit is even)\n",
    "- 92.85 rounds \"down\" to 92.8 (the dropped digit is 5 , and the retained digit is even)\n",

Unlike the Celsius and Fahrenheit scales, the kelvin scale is an absolute temperature scale in which 0 (zero) K corresponds to the lowest temperature that can theoretically be achieved. Since the kelvin temperature scale is absolute, a degree symbol is not included in the unit abbreviation, K.

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Chemistry in Context\n",
    "\n",
    "Chemistry deals with the composition, structure, and properties of matter, and the ways by which various forms of matter may be interconverted. Thus, it occupies a central place in the study and practice of science and technology. Chemists use the scientific method to perform experiments, pose hypotheses, and formulate laws and develop theories, so that they can better understand the behavior of the natural world. To do so, they operate in the macroscopic, microscopic, and symbolic domains. Chemists measure, analyze, purify, and synthesize a wide variety of substances that are important to our lives.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Phases and Classification of Matter\n",
    "\n",
    "Matter is anything that occupies space and has mass. The basic building block of matter is the atom, the smallest unit of an element that can enter into combinations with atoms of the same or other elements. In many substances, atoms are combined into molecules. On earth, matter commonly exists in three states: solids, of fixed shape and volume; liquids, of variable shape but fixed volume; and gases, of variable shape and volume. Under high-temperature conditions, matter also can exist as a plasma. Most matter is a mixture: It is composed of two or more types of matter that can be present in varying amounts and can be separated by physical means. Heterogeneous mixtures vary in composition from point to point; homogeneous mixtures have the same composition from point to point. Pure substances consist of only one type of matter. A pure substance can be an element, which consists of only one type of atom and cannot be broken down by a chemical change, or a compound, which consists of two or more types of atoms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Physical and Chemical Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "All substances have distinct physical and chemical properties, and may undergo physical or chemical changes. Physical properties, such as hardness and boiling point, and physical changes, such as melting or freezing, do not involve a change in the composition of matter. Chemical properties, such flammability and acidity, and chemical changes, such as rusting, involve production of matter that differs from that present beforehand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Measurable properties fall into one of two categories. Extensive properties depend on the amount of matter present, for example, the mass of gold. Intensive properties do not depend on the amount of matter present, for example, the density of gold. Heat is an example of an extensive property, and temperature is an example of an intensive property.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.4 Measurements\n",
    "\n",
    "Measurements provide quantitative information that is critical in studying and practicing chemistry. Each measurement has an amount, a unit for comparison, and an uncertainty. Measurements can be represented in either decimal or scientific notation. Scientists primarily use SI (International System) units such as meters, seconds, and kilograms, as well as derived units, such as liters (for volume) and $\\mathrm{g} / \\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ (for density). In many cases, it is convenient\n",
    "\n",
    "to use prefixes that yield fractional and multiple units, such as microseconds ( $10^{-6}$ seconds) and megahertz ( $10^{6}$ hertz), respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1.5 Measurement Uncertainty, Accuracy, and Precision \n",
    "\n",
    "Quantities can be defined or measured. Measured quantities have an associated uncertainty that is represented by the number of significant figures in the quantity's number. The uncertainty of a calculated quantity depends on the uncertainties in the quantities used in the calculation and is reflected in how the value is rounded. Quantities are characterized with regard to accuracy (closeness to a true or accepted value) and precision (variation among replicate measurement results).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.6 Mathematical Treatment of Measurement Results\n",
    "\n",
    "Measurements are made using a variety of units. It is often useful or necessary to convert a measured quantity from one unit into another. These conversions are accomplished using unit conversion factors, which are derived by simple applications of a mathematical approach called the factor-label method or dimensional analysis. This strategy is also employed to calculate sought quantities using measured quantities and appropriate mathematical relations.\n",
