    "\n",
    "Liquid water is essential to life on our planet, and chemistry involving the characteristic ions of water, $\\mathrm{H}^{+}$and $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$, is widely encountered in nature and society. As introduced in another chapter of this text, acid-base chemistry involves the transfer of hydrogen ions from donors (acids) to acceptors (bases). These $\\mathrm{H}+$ transfer reactions are reversible, and the equilibria established by acid-base systems are essential aspects of phenomena ranging from sinkhole formation (Figure 14.1) to oxygen transport in the human body. This chapter will further explore acid-base chemistry with an emphasis on the equilibrium aspects of this important reaction class.\n",

    "### 14.1 Brønsted-Lowry Acids and Bases \n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identify acids, bases, and conjugate acid-base pairs according to the Brønsted-Lowry definition\n",
    "- Write equations for acid and base ionization reactions\n",
    "- Use the ion-product constant for water to calculate hydronium and hydroxide ion concentrations\n",
    "- Describe the acid-base behavior of amphiprotic substances\n",
    "\n",
    "The acid-base reaction class has been studied for quite some time. In 1680, Robert Boyle reported traits of acid solutions that included their ability to dissolve many substances, to change the colors of certain natural dyes, and to lose these traits after coming in contact with alkali (base) solutions. In the eighteenth century, it was recognized that acids have a sour taste, react with limestone to liberate a gaseous substance (now known to be $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ ), and interact with alkalis to form neutral substances. In 1815, Humphry Davy contributed greatly to the development of the modern acid-base concept by demonstrating that hydrogen is the essential constituent of acids. Around that same time, Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac concluded that acids are substances that can neutralize bases and that these two classes of substances can be defined only in terms of each other. The significance of hydrogen was reemphasized in 1884 when Svante Arrhenius defined an acid as a compound that dissolves in water to yield hydrogen cations (now recognized to be hydronium ions) and a base as a compound that dissolves in water to yield hydroxide anions.\n",
    "Johannes Brønsted and Thomas Lowry proposed a more general description in 1923 in which acids and bases were defined in terms of the transfer of hydrogen ions, $\\mathrm{H}^{+}$. (Note that these hydrogen ions are often referred to simply as protons, since that subatomic particle is the only component of cations derived from the most abundant hydrogen isotope, ${ }^{1} \\mathrm{H}$.) A compound that donates a proton to another compound is called a Brønsted-Lowry acid, and a compound that accepts a proton is called a Brønsted-Lowry base. An acid-base reaction is, thus, the transfer of a proton from a donor (acid) to an acceptor (base).\n",
    "The concept of conjugate pairs is useful in describing Brønsted-Lowry acid-base reactions (and other reversible reactions, as well). When an acid donates $\\mathrm{H}^{+}$, the species that remains is called the conjugate base of the acid because it reacts as a proton acceptor in the reverse reaction. Likewise, when a base accepts $\\mathrm{H}^{+}$, it is converted to its conjugate acid. The reaction between water and ammonia illustrates this idea. In the forward direction, water acts as an acid by donating a proton to ammonia and subsequently becoming a hydroxide ion, $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$, the conjugate base of water. The ammonia acts as a base in accepting this proton, becoming an ammonium ion, $\\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$, the conjugate acid of ammonia. In the reverse direction, a hydroxide ion acts as a base in accepting a proton from ammonium ion, which acts as an acid.\n",
    "![Image](Chapter_14_images/img-1.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The reaction between a Brønsted-Lowry acid and water is called acid ionization. For example, when hydrogen fluoride dissolves in water and ionizes, protons are transferred from hydrogen fluoride molecules to water molecules, yielding hydronium ions and fluoride ions:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Image](Chapter_14_images/img-2.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Base ionization of a species occurs when it accepts protons from water molecules. In the example below, pyridine molecules, $\\mathrm{C}_{5} \\mathrm{NH}_{5}$, undergo base ionization when dissolved in water, yielding hydroxide and pyridinium ions:\n",
    "![Image](Chapter_14_images/img-3.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The preceding ionization reactions suggest that water may function as both a base (as in its reaction with hydrogen fluoride) and an acid (as in its reaction with ammonia). Species capable of either donating or accepting protons are called amphiprotric, or more generally, amphoteric, a term that may be used for acids and bases per definitions other than the Brønsted-Lowry one. The equations below show the two possible acid-base reactions for two amphiprotic species, bicarbonate ion and water:\n",

    "The first equation represents the reaction of bicarbonate as an acid with water as a base, whereas the second represents reaction of bicarbonate as a base with water as an acid. When bicarbonate is added to water, both these equilibria are established simultaneously and the composition of the resulting solution may be determined through appropriate equilibrium calculations, as described later in this chapter.\n",

Liquid water undergoes autoionization to a very slight extent; at $25^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$, approximately two out of every billion water molecules are ionized.

In North America and Europe until the 1980s, it was responsible for the destruction of forests and freshwater lakes, when the acidity of the rain actually killed trees, damaged soil, and made lakes uninhabitable for all but the most acid-tolerant species. Acid rain also corrodes statuary and building facades that are made of marble and limestone (Figure 14.3). Regulations limiting the amount of sulfur and nitrogen oxides that can be released into the atmosphere by industry and automobiles have reduced the severity of acid damage to both natural and manmade environments in North America and Europe.

    "#### Ternary Acids and Bases\n",
    "\n",
    "Ternary compounds composed of hydrogen, oxygen, and some third element (\"E\") may be structured as depicted in the image below. In these compounds, the central E atom is bonded to one or more O atoms, and at least one of the O atoms is also bonded to an H atom, corresponding to the general molecular formula $\\mathrm{O}_{\\mathrm{m}} \\mathrm{E}(\\mathrm{OH})_{n}$. These compounds may be acidic, basic, or amphoteric depending on the properties of the central E atom. Examples of such compounds include sulfuric acid, $\\mathrm{O}_{2} \\mathrm{~S}(\\mathrm{OH})_{2}$, sulfurous acid, $\\mathrm{OS}(\\mathrm{OH})_{2}$, nitric acid, $\\mathrm{O}_{2} \\mathrm{NOH}$, perchloric acid, $\\mathrm{O}_{3} \\mathrm{ClOH}$, aluminum hydroxide, $\\mathrm{Al}(\\mathrm{OH})_{3}$, calcium hydroxide, $\\mathrm{Ca}(\\mathrm{OH})_{2}$, and potassium hydroxide, KOH :\n",
    "\n",
    "![Image](Chapter_14_images/img-16.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "If the central atom, E, has a low electronegativity, its attraction for electrons is low. Little tendency exists for the central atom to form a strong covalent bond with the oxygen atom, and bond $a$ between the element and oxygen is more readily broken than bond $b$ between oxygen and hydrogen. Hence bond $a$ is ionic, hydroxide ions are released to the solution, and the material behaves as a base-this is the case with $\\mathrm{Ca}(\\mathrm{OH})_{2}$ and KOH . Lower electronegativity is characteristic of the more metallic elements; hence, the metallic elements form ionic hydroxides that are by definition basic compounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "If, on the other hand, the atom E has a relatively high electronegativity, it strongly attracts the electrons it shares with the oxygen atom, making bond $a$ relatively strongly covalent. The oxygen-hydrogen bond, bond $b$, is thereby weakened because electrons are displaced toward E. Bond $b$ is polar and readily releases hydrogen ions to the solution, so the material behaves as an acid. High electronegativities are characteristic of the more nonmetallic elements. Thus, nonmetallic elements form covalent compounds containing acidic -OH groups that are called oxyacids.\n",
    "\n",
    "Increasing the oxidation number of the central atom E also increases the acidity of an oxyacid because this increases the attraction of E for the electrons it shares with oxygen and thereby weakens the $\\mathrm{O}-\\mathrm{H}$ bond. Sulfuric acid, $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{SO}_{4}$, or $\\mathrm{O}_{2} \\mathrm{~S}(\\mathrm{OH})_{2}$ (with a sulfur oxidation number of +6 ), is more acidic than sulfurous acid, $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{SO}_{3}$, or $\\mathrm{OS}(\\mathrm{OH})_{2}$ (with a sulfur oxidation number of +4 ). Likewise nitric acid, $\\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$, or $\\mathrm{O}_{2} \\mathrm{NOH}$ ( N oxidation number $=+5$ ), is more acidic than nitrous acid, $\\mathrm{HNO}_{2}$, or $\\mathrm{ONOH}(\\mathrm{N}$ oxidation number $=+3$ ). In each of these pairs, the oxidation number of the central atom is larger for the stronger acid (Figure 14.12).\n",

    "A solution containing appreciable amounts of a weak conjugate acid-base pair is called a buffer solution, or a buffer. Buffer solutions resist a change in pH when small amounts of a strong acid or a strong base are added (Figure 14.14). A solution of acetic acid and sodium acetate $\\left(\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{COOH}+\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{COONa}\\right)$ is an example of a buffer that consists of a weak acid and its salt.

    "\n",
    "To illustrate the function of a buffer solution, consider a mixture of roughly equal amounts of acetic acid and sodium acetate. The presence of a weak conjugate acid-base pair in the solution imparts the ability to neutralize modest amounts of added strong acid or base. For example, adding strong base to this solution will neutralize hydronium ion and shift the acetic acid ionization equilibrium to the right, partially restoring the decreased $\\mathrm{H}_{3} \\mathrm{O}^{+}$concentration:\n",

Figure 14.15 provides a graphical illustration of the changes in conjugate-partner concentration that occur in this buffer solution when strong acid and base are added. The buffering action of the solution is essentially a result of the added strong acid and base being converted to the weak acid and base that make up the buffer's conjugate pair. The weaker acid and base undergo only slight ionization, as compared with the complete ionization of the strong acid and base, and the solution pH , therefore, changes much less drastically than it would in an unbuffered solution.\n",

    "#### Buffer Capacity\n",
    "\n",
    "Buffer solutions do not have an unlimited capacity to keep the pH relatively constant (Figure 14.16). Instead, the ability of a buffer solution to resist changes in pH relies on the presence of appreciable amounts of its conjugate weak acid-base pair. When enough strong acid or base is added to substantially lower the concentration of either member of the buffer pair, the buffering action within the solution is compromised.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Image](Chapter_14_images/img-22.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 14.16 The indicator color (methyl orange) shows that a small amount of acid added to a buffered solution of pH 8 (beaker on the left) has little affect on the buffered system (middle beaker). However, a large amount of acid exhausts the buffering capacity of the solution and the pH changes dramatically (beaker on the right). (credit: modification of work by Mark Ott)\n",
    "\n",
    "The buffer capacity is the amount of acid or base that can be added to a given volume of a buffer solution before the pH changes significantly, usually by one unit. Buffer capacity depends on the amounts of the weak acid and its conjugate base that are in a buffer mixture. For example, 1 L of a solution that is 1.0 M in acetic acid and 1.0 M in sodium acetate has a greater buffer capacity than 1 L of a solution that is 0.10 M in acetic acid and 0.10 M in sodium acetate even though both solutions have the same pH . The first solution has more buffer capacity because it contains more acetic acid and acetate ion.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Selection of Suitable Buffer Mixtures \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two useful rules of thumb for selecting buffer mixtures:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A good buffer mixture should have about equal concentrations of both of its components. A buffer solution has generally lost its usefulness when one component of the buffer pair is less than about $10 \\%$ of the other. Figure 14.17 shows how pH changes for an acetic acid-acetate ion buffer as base is added. The initial pH is 4.74. A change of 1 pH unit occurs when the acetic acid concentration is reduced to $11 \\%$ of the acetate ion concentration.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Image](Chapter_14_images/img-23.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 14.17 Change in pH as an increasing amount of a $0.10-\\mathrm{M} \\mathrm{NaOH}$ solution is added to 100 mL of a buffer solution in which, initially, $\\left[\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{CO}_{2} \\mathrm{H}\\right]=0.10 \\mathrm{M}$ and $\\left[\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{CO}_{2}{ }^{-}\\right]=0.10 \\mathrm{M}$. Note the greatly diminished buffering action occurring after the buffer capacity has been reached, resulting in drastic rises in pH on adding more strong base.\n",
    "2. Weak acids and their salts are better as buffers for pHs less than 7; weak bases and their salts are better as buffers for pHs greater than 7 .\n",
    "\n",
    "Blood is an important example of a buffered solution, with the principal acid and ion responsible for the buffering action being carbonic acid, $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{CO}_{3}$, and the bicarbonate ion, $\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$. When a hydronium ion is introduced to the blood stream, it is removed primarily by the reaction:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathrm{H}_{3} \\mathrm{O}^{+}(a q)+\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}(a q) \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{CO}_{3}(a q)+\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}(l)\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The added strong acid or base is thus effectively converted to the much weaker acid or base of the buffer pair $\\left(\\mathrm{H}_{3} \\mathrm{O}^{+}\\right.$ is converted to $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{CO}_{3}$ and $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$is converted to $\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$). The pH of human blood thus remains very near the value determined by the buffer pairs pKa , in this case, 7.35. Normal variations in blood pH are usually less than 0.1 , and pH changes of 0.4 or greater are likely to be fatal.\n",

    "#### Portrait of a Chemist \n",
    "\n",
    "**Lawrence Joseph Henderson and Karl Albert Hasselbalch**\n",
    "\n",
    "Lawrence Joseph Henderson (1878-1942) was an American physician, biochemist and physiologist, to name only a few of his many pursuits. He obtained a medical degree from Harvard and then spent 2 years studying in Strasbourg, then a part of Germany, before returning to take a lecturer position at Harvard. He eventually became a professor at Harvard and worked there his entire life. He discovered that the acid-base balance in human blood is regulated by a buffer system formed by the dissolved carbon dioxide in blood. He wrote an equation in 1908 to describe the carbonic acid-carbonate buffer system in blood. Henderson was broadly knowledgeable; in addition to his important research on the physiology of blood, he also wrote on the adaptations of organisms and their fit with their environments, on sociology and on university education. He also founded the Fatigue Laboratory, at the Harvard Business School, which examined human physiology with specific focus on work in industry, exercise, and nutrition.\n",
    "In 1916, Karl Albert Hasselbalch (1874-1962), a Danish physician and chemist, shared authorship in a paper with Christian Bohr in 1904 that described the Bohr effect, which showed that the ability of hemoglobin in the blood to bind with oxygen was inversely related to the acidity of the blood and the concentration of carbon dioxide. The pH scale was introduced in 1909 by another Dane, Sørensen, and in 1912, Hasselbalch published measurements of the pH of blood. In 1916, Hasselbalch expressed Henderson's equation in logarithmic terms, consistent with the logarithmic scale of pH , and thus the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation was born.\n",

    "The normal pH of human blood is about 7.4. The carbonate buffer system in the blood uses the following equilibrium reaction:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The concentration of carbonic acid, $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{CO}_{3}$ is approximately 0.0012 M , and the concentration of the hydrogen carbonate ion, $\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$, is around 0.024 M . Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation and the $\\mathrm{p} K_{\\mathrm{a}}$ of carbonic acid at body temperature, we can calculate the pH of blood:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathrm{pH}=\\mathrm{p} K_{\\mathrm{a}}+\\log \\frac{[\\text { base }]}{[\\text { acid }]}=6.4+\\log \\frac{0.024}{0.0012}=7.7\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that the $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{CO}_{3}$ concentration is significantly lower than that of the $\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$ion may seem unusual, but this imbalance is due to the fact that most of the by-products of our metabolism that enter our bloodstream are acidic. Therefore, there must be a larger proportion of base than acid, so that the capacity of the buffer will not be exceeded.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lactic acid is produced in our muscles when we exercise. As the lactic acid enters the bloodstream, it is neutralized by the $\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$ion, producing $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{CO}_{3}$. An enzyme then accelerates the breakdown of the excess carbonic acid to carbon dioxide and water, which can be eliminated by breathing. In fact, in addition to the regulating effects of the carbonate buffering system on the pH of blood, the body uses breathing to regulate blood pH . If the pH of the blood decreases too far, an increase in breathing removes $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ from the blood through the lungs driving the equilibrium reaction such that $\\left[\\mathrm{H}_{3} \\mathrm{O}^{+}\\right]$is lowered. If the blood is too alkaline, a lower breath rate increases $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ concentration in the blood, driving the equilibrium reaction the other way, increasing $\\left[\\mathrm{H}^{+}\\right]$and restoring an appropriate pH .\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Titration Curves\n",
    "\n",
    "A titration curve is a plot of some solution property versus the amount of added titrant. For acid-base titrations, solution pH is a useful property to monitor because it varies predictably with the solution composition and, therefore, may be used to monitor the titration's progress and detect its end point. The following example exercise demonstrates the computation of pH for a titration solution after additions of several specified titrant volumes. The first example involves a strong acid titration that requires only stoichiometric calculations to derive the solution pH . The second example addresses a weak acid titration requiring equilibrium calculations.\n",

    "\n",
    "A titration is carried out for 25.00 mL of 0.100 M HCl (strong acid) with 0.100 M of a strong base NaOH (the titration curve is shown in Figure 14.18). Calculate the pH at these volumes of added base solution:\n",

Since the acid sample and the base titrant are both monoprotic and equally concentrated, this titrant addition involves less than a stoichiometric amount of base, and so it is completely consumed by reaction with the excess acid in the sample. The concentration of acid remaining is computed by subtracting the consumed amount from the intial amount and then dividing by the solution volume:\n",

    "Certain organic substances change color in dilute solution when the hydronium ion concentration reaches a particular value.

In more basic solutions where the hydronium ion concentration is less than $5.0 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{M}(\\mathrm{pH}>8.3)$, it is red or pink. Substances such as phenolphthalein, which can be used to determine the pH of a solution, are called acid-base indicators. Acid-base indicators are either weak organic acids or weak organic bases.\n",

    "The anion of methyl orange, $\\mathrm{In}^{-}$, is yellow, and the nonionized form, HIn, is red.

If we add base, we shift the equilibrium towards the yellow form. This behavior is completely analogous to the action of buffers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The perceived color of an indicator solution is determined by the ratio of the concentrations of the two species $\\mathrm{In}^{-}$and HIn . If most of the indicator (typically about $60-90 \\%$ or more) is present as $\\mathrm{In}^{-}$, the perceived color of the solution is yellow. If most is present as HIn, then the solution color appears red. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is useful for understanding the relationship between the pH of an indicator solution and its composition (thus, perceived color):\n",

When $\\mathrm{pH}>\\mathrm{p} K_{\\mathrm{a}}$, the log term must be negative, indicating an excess of the conjugate acid (red solution). When the solution pH is close to the indicator pKa , appreciable amounts of both conjugate partners are present, and the solution color is that of an additive combination of each (yellow and red, yielding orange). The color change interval (or pH interval) for an acid-base indicator is defined as the range of pH values over which a change in color is observed, and for most indicators this range is approximately $\\mathrm{p} K_{\\mathrm{a}} \\pm 1$.\n",

    "Figure 14.20 Titration curves for strong and weak acids illustrating the proper choice of acid-base indicator. Any of the three indicators will exhibit a reasonably sharp color change at the equivalence point of the strong acid titration, but only phenolphthalein is suitable for use in the weak acid titration.\n",
    "\n",
    "The titration curves shown in Figure 14.20 illustrate the choice of a suitable indicator for specific titrations. In the strong acid titration, use of any of the three indicators should yield reasonably sharp color changes and accurate end point determinations. For this titration, the solution pH reaches the lower limit of the methyl orange color change interval after addition of $\\sim 24 \\mathrm{~mL}$ of titrant, at which point the initially red solution would begin to appear orange. When 25 mL of titrant has been added (the equivalence point), the pH is well above the upper limit and the solution will appear yellow. The titration's end point may then be estimated as the volume of titrant that yields a distinct orange-to-yellow color change. This color change would be challenging for most human eyes to precisely discern. More-accurate estimates of the titration end point are possible using either litmus or phenolphthalein, both of which exhibit color change intervals that are encompassed by the steep rise in pH that occurs around the 25.00 mL equivalence point.\n",
    "The weak acid titration curve in Figure 14.20 shows that only one of the three indicators is suitable for end point detection. If methyl orange is used in this titration, the solution will undergo a gradual red-to-orange-to-yellow color change over a relatively large volume interval $(0-6 \\mathrm{~mL})$, completing the color change well before the equivalence point $(25 \\mathrm{~mL})$ has been reached. Use of litmus would show a color change that begins after adding $7-8 \\mathrm{~mL}$ of titrant and ends just before the equivalence point. Phenolphthalein, on the other hand, exhibits a color change interval that nicely brackets the abrupt change in pH occurring at the titration's equivalence point. A sharp color change from colorless to pink will be observed within a very small volume interval around the equivalence point.\n",

    "#### 14.1 Brønsted-Lowry Acids and Bases\n",
    "\n",
    "A compound that can donate a proton (a hydrogen ion) to another compound is called a Brønsted-Lowry acid. The compound that accepts the proton is called a Brønsted-Lowry base. The species remaining after a Brønsted-Lowry acid has lost a proton is the conjugate base of the acid. The species formed when a Brønsted-Lowry base gains a proton is the conjugate acid of the base. Thus, an acid-base reaction occurs when a proton is transferred from an acid to a base, with formation of the conjugate base of the reactant acid and formation of the conjugate acid of the reactant base. Amphiprotic species can act as both proton donors and proton acceptors. Water is the most important amphiprotic species. It can form both the hydronium ion, $\\mathrm{H}_{3} \\mathrm{O}^{+}$, and the hydroxide ion, $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$when it undergoes autoionization:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 14.2 pH and pOH \n",
    "\n",
    "Concentrations of hydronium and hydroxide ions in aqueous media are often represented as logarithmic pH and pOH values, respectively. At $25^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$, the autoprotolysis equilibrium for water requires the sum of pH and pOH to equal 14 for any aqueous solution. The relative concentrations of hydronium and hydroxide ion in a solution define its status as acidic $\\left(\\left[\\mathrm{H}_{3} \\mathrm{O}^{+}\\right]>\\left[\\mathrm{OH}^{-}\\right]\\right)$, basic $\\left(\\left[\\mathrm{H}_{3} \\mathrm{O}^{+}\\right]<\\left[\\mathrm{OH}^{-}\\right]\\right)$, or neutral $\\left(\\left[\\mathrm{H}_{3} \\mathrm{O}^{+}\\right]=\\left[\\mathrm{OH}^{-}\\right]\\right)$. At $25^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$, a $\\mathrm{pH}<7$ indicates an acidic solution, a $\\mathrm{pH}>7$ a basic solution, and a $\\mathrm{pH}=7$ a neutral solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 14.3 Relative Strengths of Acids and Bases\n",
    "\n",
    "The relative strengths of acids and bases are reflected in the magnitudes of their ionization constants; the stronger the acid or base, the larger its ionization constant. A reciprocal relation exists between the strengths of a conjugate acid-base pair: the stronger the acid, the weaker its conjugate base. Water exerts a leveling effect on dissolved acids or bases, reacting completely to generate its characteristic hydronium and hydroxide ions (the strongest acid and base that may exist in water). The strengths of the binary acids increase from left to right across a period of the periodic table $\\left(\\mathrm{CH}_{4}<\\mathrm{NH}_{3}<\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}<\\mathrm{HF}\\right)$, and they increase down a group $(\\mathrm{HF}<\\mathrm{HCl}<\\mathrm{HBr}<\\mathrm{HI})$. The strengths of oxyacids that contain the same central element increase as the oxidation number of the element increases $\\left(\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{SO}_{3}<\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{SO}_{4}\\right)$. The strengths of oxyacids also increase as the electronegativity of the central element increases $\\left[\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{SeO}_{4}<\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{SO}_{4}\\right]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 14.4 Hydrolysis of Salts\n",
    "\n",
    "The ions composing salts may possess acidic or basic character, ionizing when dissolved in water to yield acidic or basic solutions. Acidic cations are typically the conjugate partners of weak bases, and basic anions are the conjugate partners of weak acids. Many metal ions bond to water molecules when dissolved to yield complex ions that may function as acids.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 14.5 Polyprotic Acids\n",
    "\n",
    "An acid that contains more than one ionizable proton is a polyprotic acid. These acids undergo stepwise ionization reactions involving the transfer of single protons. The ionization constants for polyprotic acids decrease with each subsequent step; these decreases typically are large enough to permit simple equilibrium calculations that treat each step separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 14.6 Buffers\n",
    "\n",
    "Solutions that contain appreciable amounts of a weak conjugate acid-base pair are called buffers. A buffered solution will experience only slight changes in pH when small amounts of acid or base are added. Addition of large amounts of acid or base can exceed the buffer capacity, consuming most of one conjugate partner and preventing further buffering action.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 14.7 Acid-Base Titrations\n",
    "\n",
    "The titration curve for an acid-base titration is typically a plot of pH versus volume of added titrant. These curves are useful in selecting appropriate acid-base indicators that will permit accurate determinations of titration end points.\n",
