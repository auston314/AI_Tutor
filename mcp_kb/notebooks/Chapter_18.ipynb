    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The development of the periodic table in the mid-1800s came from observations that there was a periodic relationship between the properties of the elements. Chemists, who have an understanding of the variations of these properties, have been able to use this knowledge to solve a wide variety of technical challenges. For example, silicon and other semiconductors form the backbone of modern electronics because of our ability to fine-tune the electrical properties of these materials. This chapter explores important properties of representative metals, metalloids, and nonmetals in the periodic table.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 18.1 Periodicity \n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Classify elements\n",
    "- Make predictions about the periodicity properties of the representative elements\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin this section by examining the behaviors of representative metals in relation to their positions in the periodic table. The primary focus of this section will be the application of periodicity to the representative metals.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to divide elements into groups according to their electron configurations. The representative elements are elements where the $s$ and $p$ orbitals are filling. The transition elements are elements where the $d$ orbitals (groups $3-11$ on the periodic table) are filling, and the inner transition metals are the elements where the $f$ orbitals are filling. The $d$ orbitals fill with the elements in group 11; therefore, the elements in group 12 qualify as representative elements because the last electron enters an $s$ orbital. Metals among the representative elements are the representative metals. Metallic character results from an element's ability to lose its outer valence electrons and results in high thermal and electrical conductivity, among other physical and chemical properties. There are 20 nonradioactive representative metals in groups 1, 2, 3, 12, 13, 14, and 15 of the periodic table (the elements shaded in yellow in Figure 18.2). The radioactive elements copernicium, flerovium, polonium, and livermorium are also metals but are beyond the scope of this chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the representative metals, some of the representative elements are metalloids. A metalloid is an element that has properties that are between those of metals and nonmetals; these elements are typically semiconductors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The remaining representative elements are nonmetals. Unlike metals, which typically form cations and ionic compounds (containing ionic bonds), nonmetals tend to form anions or molecular compounds. In general, the combination of a metal and a nonmetal produces a salt. A salt is an ionic compound consisting of cations and anions.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Image](Chapter_18_images/img-1.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 18.2 The location of the representative metals is shown in the periodic table. Nonmetals are shown in green, metalloids in purple, and the transition metals and inner transition metals in blue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the representative metals do not occur naturally in an uncombined state because they readily react with water and oxygen in the air. However, it is possible to isolate elemental beryllium, magnesium, zinc, cadmium, mercury, aluminum, tin, and lead from their naturally occurring minerals and use them because they react very slowly with air. Part of the reason why these elements react slowly is that these elements react with air to form a protective coating. The formation of this protective coating is passivation. The coating is a nonreactive film of oxide or some other compound. Elemental magnesium, aluminum, zinc, and tin are important in the fabrication of many familiar items, including wire, cookware, foil, and many household and personal objects. Although beryllium, cadmium, mercury, and lead are readily available, there are limitations in their use because of their toxicity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Group 1: The Alkali Metals \n",
    "\n",
    "The alkali metals lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, cesium, and francium constitute group 1 of the periodic table. Although hydrogen is in group 1 (and also in group 17), it is a nonmetal and deserves separate consideration later in this chapter. The name alkali metal is in reference to the fact that these metals and their oxides react with water to form very basic (alkaline) solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The properties of the alkali metals are similar to each other as expected for elements in the same family. The alkali\n",
    "\n",
    "metals have the largest atomic radii and the lowest first ionization energy in their periods. This combination makes it very easy to remove the single electron in the outermost (valence) shell of each. The easy loss of this valence electron means that these metals readily form stable cations with a charge of $1+$. Their reactivity increases with increasing atomic number due to the ease of losing the lone valence electron (decreasing ionization energy). Since oxidation is so easy, the reverse, reduction, is difficult, which explains why it is hard to isolate the elements. The solid alkali metals are very soft; lithium, shown in Figure 18.3, has the lowest density of any metal $\\left(0.5 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{cm}^{3}\\right)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The alkali metals all react vigorously with water to form hydrogen gas and a basic solution of the metal hydroxide. This means they are easier to oxidize than is hydrogen. As an example, the reaction of lithium with water is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "2 \\mathrm{Li}(s)+2 \\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}(l) \\longrightarrow 2 \\mathrm{LiOH}(a q)+\\mathrm{H}_{2}(g)\n",

    "\n",
    "Figure 18.3 Lithium floats in paraffin oil because its density is less than the density of paraffin oil.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alkali metals react directly with all the nonmetals (except the noble gases) to yield binary ionic compounds containing $1+$ metal ions. These metals are so reactive that it is necessary to avoid contact with both moisture and oxygen in the air. Therefore, they are stored in sealed containers under mineral oil, as shown in Figure 18.4, to prevent contact with air and moisture. The pure metals never exist free (uncombined) in nature due to their high reactivity. In addition, this high reactivity makes it necessary to prepare the metals by electrolysis of alkali metal compounds.\n",

    "\n",
    "Unlike many other metals, the reactivity and softness of the alkali metals make these metals unsuitable for structural applications. However, there are applications where the reactivity of the alkali metals is an advantage. For example, the production of metals such as titanium and zirconium relies, in part, on the ability of sodium to reduce compounds of these metals. The manufacture of many organic compounds, including certain dyes, drugs, and perfumes, utilizes reduction by lithium or sodium.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sodium and its compounds impart a bright yellow color to a flame, as seen in Figure 18.5. Passing an electrical discharge through sodium vapor also produces this color. In both cases, this is an example of an emission spectrum as discussed in the chapter on electronic structure. Streetlights sometime employ sodium vapor lights because the sodium vapor penetrates fog better than most other light. This is because the fog does not scatter yellow light as much as it scatters white light. The other alkali metals and their salts also impart color to a flame. Lithium creates a bright, crimson color, whereas the others create a pale, violet color.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Group 2: The Alkaline Earth Metals\n",
    "\n",
    "The alkaline earth metals (beryllium, magnesium, calcium, strontium, barium, and radium) constitute group 2 of the periodic table. The name alkaline metal comes from the fact that the oxides of the heavier members of the group react with water to form alkaline solutions. The nuclear charge increases when going from group 1 to group 2. Because of this charge increase, the atoms of the alkaline earth metals are smaller and have higher first ionization energies than the alkali metals within the same period. The higher ionization energy makes the alkaline earth metals less reactive than the alkali metals; however, they are still very reactive elements. Their reactivity increases, as expected, with increasing size and decreasing ionization energy. In chemical reactions, these metals readily lose both valence electrons to form compounds in which they exhibit an oxidation state of $2+$. Due to their high reactivity, it is common to produce the alkaline earth metals, like the alkali metals, by electrolysis. Even though the ionization energies are low, the two metals with the highest ionization energies (beryllium and magnesium) do form compounds that exhibit\n",
    "\n",
    "some covalent characters. Like the alkali metals, the heavier alkaline earth metals impart color to a flame. As in the case of the alkali metals, this is part of the emission spectrum of these elements. Calcium and strontium produce shades of red, whereas barium produces a green color.\n",
    "\n",
    "Magnesium is a silver-white metal that is malleable and ductile at high temperatures. Passivation decreases the reactivity of magnesium metal. Upon exposure to air, a tightly adhering layer of magnesium oxycarbonate forms on the surface of the metal and inhibits further reaction. (The carbonate comes from the reaction of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.) Magnesium is the lightest of the widely used structural metals, which is why most magnesium production is for lightweight alloys.\n",
    "\n",
    "Magnesium (shown in Figure 18.6), calcium, strontium, and barium react with water and air. At room temperature, barium shows the most vigorous reaction. The products of the reaction with water are hydrogen and the metal hydroxide. The formation of hydrogen gas indicates that the heavier alkaline earth metals are better reducing agents (more easily oxidized) than is hydrogen. As expected, these metals react with both acids and nonmetals to form ionic compounds. Unlike most salts of the alkali metals, many of the common salts of the alkaline earth metals are insoluble in water because of the high lattice energies of these compounds, containing a divalent metal ion.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The potent reducing power of hot magnesium is useful in preparing some metals from their oxides. Indeed, magnesium's affinity for oxygen is so great that burning magnesium reacts with carbon dioxide, producing elemental carbon:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "2 \\mathrm{Mg}(s)+\\mathrm{CO}_{2}(g) \\longrightarrow 2 \\mathrm{MgO}(s)+\\mathrm{C}(s)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, a $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ fire extinguisher will not extinguish a magnesium fire. Additionally, the brilliant white light emitted by burning magnesium makes it useful in flares and fireworks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Group 12 \n",
    "\n",
    "The elements in group 12 are transition elements; however, the last electron added is not a $d$ electron, but an $s$ electron. Since the last electron added is an $s$ electron, these elements qualify as representative metals, or post-transition metals. The group 12 elements behave more like the alkaline earth metals than transition metals. Group 12 contains the four elements zinc, cadmium, mercury, and copernicium. Each of these elements has two electrons in its outer shell $\\left(n s^{2}\\right)$. When atoms of these metals form cations with a charge of $2+$, where the two outer electrons are lost, they have pseudo-noble gas electron configurations. Mercury is sometimes an exception because it also exhibits an oxidation state of $1+$ in compounds that contain a diatomic $\\mathrm{Hg}_{2}{ }^{2+}$ ion. In their elemental forms and in compounds, cadmium and mercury are both toxic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Zinc is the most reactive in group 12, and mercury is the least reactive. (This is the reverse of the reactivity trend of the metals of groups 1 and 2, in which reactivity increases down a group. The increase in reactivity with increasing atomic number only occurs for the metals in groups 1 and 2.) The decreasing reactivity is due to the formation of ions with a pseudo-noble gas configuration and to other factors that are beyond the scope of this discussion. The chemical behaviors of zinc and cadmium are quite similar to each other but differ from that of mercury.\n",
    "\n",
    "Zinc and cadmium have lower reduction potentials than hydrogen, and, like the alkali metals and alkaline earth metals, they will produce hydrogen gas when they react with acids. The reaction of zinc with hydrochloric acid, shown in Figure 18.7, is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathrm{Zn}(s)+2 \\mathrm{H}_{3} \\mathrm{O}^{+}(a q)+2 \\mathrm{Cl}^{-}(a q) \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{H}_{2}(g)+\\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}(a q)+2 \\mathrm{Cl}^{-}(a q)+2 \\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}(l)\n",
    "$$\n",

    "![Image](Chapter_18_images/img-6.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 18.7 Zinc is an active metal. It dissolves in hydrochloric acid, forming a solution of colorless $\\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}$ ions, $\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ ions, and hydrogen gas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Zinc is a silvery metal that quickly tarnishes to a blue-gray appearance. This change in color is due to an adherent coating of a basic carbonate, $\\mathrm{Zn}_{2}(\\mathrm{OH})_{2} \\mathrm{CO}_{3}$, which passivates the metal to inhibit further corrosion. Dry cell and alkaline batteries contain a zinc anode. Brass ( Cu and Zn ) and some bronze ( $\\mathrm{Cu}, \\mathrm{Sn}$, and sometimes Zn ) are important zinc alloys. About half of zinc production serves to protect iron and other metals from corrosion. This protection may take the form of a sacrificial anode (also known as a galvanic anode, which is a means of providing cathodic protection for various metals) or as a thin coating on the protected metal. Galvanized steel is steel with a protective coating of zinc.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Chemistry in Everyday Life \n",
    "\n",
    "**Sacrificial Anodes**\n",
    "\n",
    "A sacrificial anode, or galvanic anode, is a means of providing cathodic protection of various metals. Cathodic protection refers to the prevention of corrosion by converting the corroding metal into a cathode. As a cathode, the metal resists corrosion, which is an oxidation process. Corrosion occurs at the sacrificial anode instead of at the cathode.\n",
    "\n",
    "The construction of such a system begins with the attachment of a more active metal (more negative reduction potential) to the metal needing protection. Attachment may be direct or via a wire. To complete the circuit, a salt bridge is necessary. This salt bridge is often seawater or ground water. Once the circuit is complete, oxidation (corrosion) occurs at the anode and not the cathode.\n",
    "\n",
    "The commonly used sacrificial anodes are magnesium, aluminum, and zinc. Magnesium has the most negative reduction potential of the three and serves best when the salt bridge is less efficient due to a low electrolyte\n",
    "\n",
    "concentration such as in freshwater. Zinc and aluminum work better in saltwater than does magnesium. Aluminum is lighter than zinc and has a higher capacity; however, an oxide coating may passivate the aluminum. In special cases, other materials are useful. For example, iron will protect copper.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mercury is very different from zinc and cadmium. Mercury is the only metal that is liquid at $25^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$. Many metals dissolve in mercury, forming solutions called amalgams (see the feature on Amalgams), which are alloys of mercury with one or more other metals. Mercury, shown in Figure 18.8, is a nonreactive element that is more difficult to oxidize than hydrogen. Thus, it does not displace hydrogen from acids; however, it will react with strong oxidizing acids, such as nitric acid:\n",

    "Most mercury compounds decompose when heated. Most mercury compounds contain mercury with a 2+-oxidation state. When there is a large excess of mercury, it is possible to form compounds containing the $\\mathrm{Hg}_{2}{ }^{2+}$ ion. All mercury compounds are toxic, and it is necessary to exercise great care in their synthesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Chemistry in Everyday Life \n",
    "\n",
    "**Amalgams**\n",
    "\n",
    "An amalgam is an alloy of mercury with one or more other metals. This is similar to considering steel to be an alloy of iron with other metals. Most metals will form an amalgam with mercury, with the main exceptions being iron, platinum, tungsten, and tantalum.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to toxicity issues with mercury, there has been a significant decrease in the use of amalgams. Historically, amalgams were important in electrolytic cells and in the extraction of gold. Amalgams of the alkali metals still find use because they are strong reducing agents and easier to handle than the pure alkali metals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prospectors had a problem when they found finely divided gold. They learned that adding mercury to their pans\n",
    "\n",
    "collected the gold into the mercury to form an amalgam for easier collection. Unfortunately, losses of small amounts of mercury over the years left many streams in California polluted with mercury.\n",
    "Dentists use amalgams containing silver and other metals to fill cavities. There are several reasons to use an amalgam including low cost, ease of manipulation, and longevity compared to alternate materials. Dental amalgams are approximately $50 \\%$ mercury by weight, which, in recent years, has become a concern due to the toxicity of mercury.\n",
    "After reviewing the best available data, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers amalgam-based fillings to be safe for adults and children over six years of age. Even with multiple fillings, the mercury levels in the patients remain far below the lowest levels associated with harm. Clinical studies have found no link between dental amalgams and health problems. Health issues may not be the same in cases of children under six or pregnant women. The FDA conclusions are in line with the opinions of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Centers for Disease Control (CDC). The only health consideration noted is that some people are allergic to the amalgam or one of its components.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Group 13 \n",
    "\n",
    "Group 13 contains the metalloid boron and the metals aluminum, gallium, indium, and thallium. The lightest element, boron, is semiconducting, and its binary compounds tend to be covalent and not ionic. The remaining elements of the group are metals, but their oxides and hydroxides change characters. The oxides and hydroxides of aluminum and gallium exhibit both acidic and basic behaviors. A substance, such as these two, that will react with both acids and bases is amphoteric. This characteristic illustrates the combination of nonmetallic and metallic behaviors of these two elements. Indium and thallium oxides and hydroxides exhibit only basic behavior, in accordance with the clearly metallic character of these two elements. The melting point of gallium is unusually low (about $30^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ ) and will melt in your hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aluminum is amphoteric because it will react with both acids and bases. A typical reaction with an acid is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "2 \\mathrm{Al}(s)+6 \\mathrm{HCl}(a q) \\longrightarrow 2 \\mathrm{AlCl}_{3}(a q)+3 \\mathrm{H}_{2}(g)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The products of the reaction of aluminum with a base depend upon the reaction conditions, with the following being one possibility:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "2 \\mathrm{Al}(s)+2 \\mathrm{NaOH}(a q)+6 \\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}(l) \\longrightarrow 2 \\mathrm{Na}\\left[\\mathrm{Al}(\\mathrm{OH})_{4}\\right](a q)+3 \\mathrm{H}_{2}(g)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "With both acids and bases, the reaction with aluminum generates hydrogen gas.\n",
    "The group 13 elements have a valence shell electron configuration of $n s^{2} n p^{1}$. Aluminum normally uses all of its valence electrons when it reacts, giving compounds in which it has an oxidation state of $3+$. Although many of these compounds are covalent, others, such as $\\mathrm{AlF}_{3}$ and $\\mathrm{Al}_{2}\\left(\\mathrm{SO}_{4}\\right)_{3}$, are ionic. Aqueous solutions of aluminum salts contain the cation $\\left[\\mathrm{Al}\\left(\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}\\right)_{6}\\right]^{3+}$, abbreviated as $\\mathrm{Al}^{3+}(a q)$. Gallium, indium, and thallium also form ionic compounds containing $\\mathrm{M}^{3+}$ ions. These three elements exhibit not only the expected oxidation state of $3+$ from the three valence electrons but also an oxidation state (in this case, $1+$ ) that is two below the expected value. This phenomenon, the inert pair effect, refers to the formation of a stable ion with an oxidation state two lower than expected for the group. The pair of electrons is the valence $s$ orbital for those elements. In general, the inert pair effect is important for the lower $p$-block elements. In an aqueous solution, the $\\mathrm{Tl}^{+}(a q)$ ion is more stable than is $\\mathrm{Tl}^{3+}(a q)$. In general, these metals will react with air and water to form $3+$ ions; however, thallium reacts to give thallium(I) derivatives. The metals of group 13 all react directly with nonmetals such as sulfur, phosphorus, and the halogens, forming binary compounds.\n",
    "The metals of group $13(\\mathrm{Al}, \\mathrm{Ga}, \\mathrm{In}$, and Tl$)$ are all reactive. However, passivation occurs as a tough, hard, thin film of the metal oxide forms upon exposure to air. Disruption of this film may counter the passivation, allowing the metal to react. One way to disrupt the film is to expose the passivated metal to mercury. Some of the metal dissolves in the mercury to form an amalgam, which sheds the protective oxide layer to expose the metal to further reaction. The formation of an amalgam allows the metal to react with air and water.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Link to Learning** \n",
    "\n",
    "Although easily oxidized, the passivation of aluminum makes it very useful as a strong, lightweight building material. Because of the formation of an amalgam, mercury is corrosive to structural materials made of aluminum. This video (http://openstaxcollege.org/1/16aluminumhg) demonstrates how the integrity of an aluminum beam can be destroyed by the addition of a small amount of elemental mercury.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important uses of aluminum are in the construction and transportation industries, and in the manufacture of aluminum cans and aluminum foil. These uses depend on the lightness, toughness, and strength of the metal, as well as its resistance to corrosion. Because aluminum is an excellent conductor of heat and resists corrosion, it is useful in the manufacture of cooking utensils.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aluminum is a very good reducing agent and may replace other reducing agents in the isolation of certain metals from their oxides. Although more expensive than reduction by carbon, aluminum is important in the isolation of Mo, W, and Cr from their oxides.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Group 14\n",
    "\n",
    "The metallic members of group 14 are tin, lead, and flerovium. Carbon is a typical nonmetal. The remaining elements of the group, silicon and germanium, are examples of semimetals or metalloids. Tin and lead form the stable divalent cations, $\\mathrm{Sn}^{2+}$ and $\\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$, with oxidation states two below the group oxidation state of $4+$. The stability of this oxidation state is a consequence of the inert pair effect. Tin and lead also form covalent compounds with a formal 4+-oxidation state. For example, $\\mathrm{SnCl}_{4}$ and $\\mathrm{PbCl}_{4}$ are low-boiling covalent liquids.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Image](Chapter_18_images/img-8.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 18.9 (a) Tin(II) chloride is an ionic solid; (b) tin(IV) chloride is a covalent liquid.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tin reacts readily with nonmetals and acids to form tin(II) compounds (indicating that it is more easily oxidized than hydrogen) and with nonmetals to form either tin(II) or tin(IV) compounds (shown in Figure 18.9), depending on the stoichiometry and reaction conditions. Lead is less reactive. It is only slightly easier to oxidize than hydrogen, and oxidation normally requires a hot concentrated acid.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of these elements exist as allotropes. Allotropes are two or more forms of the same element in the same physical state with different chemical and physical properties. There are two common allotropes of tin. These allotropes are grey (brittle) tin and white tin. As with other allotropes, the difference between these forms of tin is in the arrangement of the atoms. White tin is stable above $13.2^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ and is malleable like other metals. At low temperatures, gray tin is the more stable form. Gray tin is brittle and tends to break down to a powder. Consequently,\n",
    "\n",
    "articles made of tin will disintegrate in cold weather, particularly if the cold spell is lengthy. The change progresses slowly from the spot of origin, and the gray tin that is first formed catalyzes further change. In a way, this effect is similar to the spread of an infection in a plant or animal body, leading people to call this process tin disease or tin pest.\n",
    "\n",
    "The principal use of tin is in the coating of steel to form tin plate-sheet iron, which constitutes the tin in tin cans. Important tin alloys are bronze ( Cu and Sn ) and solder ( Sn and Pb ). Lead is important in the lead storage batteries in automobiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Group 15 \n",
    "\n",
    "Bismuth, the heaviest member of group 15, is a less reactive metal than the other representative metals. It readily gives up three of its five valence electrons to active nonmetals to form the tri-positive ion, $\\mathrm{Bi}^{3+}$. It forms compounds with the group oxidation state of $5+$ only when treated with strong oxidizing agents. The stability of the 3+-oxidation state is another example of the inert pair effect.\n",

    "Because of their reactivity, we do not find most representative metals as free elements in nature. However, compounds that contain ions of most representative metals are abundant. In this section, we will consider the two common techniques used to isolate the metals from these compounds-electrolysis and chemical reduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "These metals primarily occur in minerals, with lithium found in silicate or phosphate minerals, and sodium and potassium found in salt deposits from evaporation of ancient seas and in silicates. The alkaline earth metals occur as silicates and, with the exception of beryllium, as carbonates and sulfates. Beryllium occurs as the mineral beryl, $\\mathrm{Be}_{3} \\mathrm{Al}_{2} \\mathrm{Si}_{6} \\mathrm{O}_{18}$, which, with certain impurities, may be either the gemstone emerald or aquamarine. Magnesium is in seawater and, along with the heavier alkaline earth metals, occurs as silicates, carbonates, and sulfates. Aluminum occurs abundantly in many types of clay and in bauxite, an impure aluminum oxide hydroxide. The principle tin ore is the oxide cassiterite, $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$, and the principle lead and thallium ores are the sulfides or the products of weathering of the sulfides. The remaining representative metals occur as impurities in zinc or aluminum ores.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Electrolysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Ions of metals in of groups 1 and 2, along with aluminum, are very difficult to reduce; therefore, it is necessary to prepare these elements by electrolysis, an important process discussed in the chapter on electrochemistry. Briefly, electrolysis involves using electrical energy to drive unfavorable chemical reactions to completion; it is useful in the isolation of reactive metals in their pure forms. Sodium, aluminum, and magnesium are typical examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Preparation of Sodium\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important method for the production of sodium is the electrolysis of molten sodium chloride; the set-up is a Downs cell, shown in Figure 18.10. The reaction involved in this process is:\n",

    "\n",
    "causes the sodium ions to migrate to the negatively charged cathode and pick up electrons, reducing the ions to sodium metal. Chloride ions migrate to the positively charged anode, lose electrons, and undergo oxidation to chlorine gas. The overall cell reaction comes from adding the following reactions:\n",

    "Separation of the molten sodium and chlorine prevents recombination. The liquid sodium, which is less dense than molten sodium chloride, floats to the surface and flows into a collector. The gaseous chlorine goes to storage tanks. Chlorine is also a valuable product.\n",

    "\n",
    "Figure 18.10 Pure sodium metal is isolated by electrolysis of molten sodium chloride using a Downs cell. It is not possible to isolate sodium by electrolysis of aqueous solutions of sodium salts because hydrogen ions are more easily reduced than are sodium ions; as a result, hydrogen gas forms at the cathode instead of the desired sodium metal. The high temperature required to melt NaCl means that liquid sodium metal forms.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Preparation of Aluminum \n",
    "\n",
    "The preparation of aluminum utilizes a process invented in 1886 by Charles M. Hall, who began to work on the problem while a student at Oberlin College in Ohio. Paul L. T. Héroult discovered the process independently a month or two later in France. In honor to the two inventors, this electrolysis cell is known as the Hall-Héroult cell. The Hall-Héroult cell is an electrolysis cell for the production of aluminum. Figure 18.11 illustrates the Hall-Héroult cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "The production of aluminum begins with the purification of bauxite, the most common source of aluminum. The reaction of bauxite, $\\mathrm{AlO}(\\mathrm{OH})$, with hot sodium hydroxide forms soluble sodium aluminate, while clay and other impurities remain undissolved:\n",

    "\n",
    "- Describe the general preparation, properties, and uses of the metalloids\n",
    "- Describe the preparation, properties, and compounds of boron and silicon\n",
    "\n",
    "A series of six elements called the metalloids separate the metals from the nonmetals in the periodic table. The metalloids are boron, silicon, germanium, arsenic, antimony, and tellurium. These elements look metallic; however, they do not conduct electricity as well as metals so they are semiconductors. They are semiconductors because their\n",
    "\n",
    "electrons are more tightly bound to their nuclei than are those of metallic conductors. Their chemical behavior falls between that of metals and nonmetals. For example, the pure metalloids form covalent crystals like the nonmetals, but like the metals, they generally do not form monatomic anions. This intermediate behavior is in part due to their intermediate electronegativity values. In this section, we will briefly discuss the chemical behavior of metalloids and deal with two of these elements-boron and silicon-in more detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "The metalloid boron exhibits many similarities to its neighbor carbon and its diagonal neighbor silicon. All three elements form covalent compounds. However, boron has one distinct difference in that its $2 s^{2} 2 p^{1}$ outer electron structure gives it one less valence electron than it has valence orbitals. Although boron exhibits an oxidation state of $3+$ in most of its stable compounds, this electron deficiency provides boron with the ability to form other, sometimes fractional, oxidation states, which occur, for example, in the boron hydrides.\n",
    "\n",
    "Silicon has the valence shell electron configuration $3 s^{2} 3 p^{2}$, and it commonly forms tetrahedral structures in which it is $s p^{3}$ hybridized with a formal oxidation state of $4+$. The major differences between the chemistry of carbon and silicon result from the relative strength of the carbon-carbon bond, carbon's ability to form stable bonds to itself, and the presence of the empty $3 d$ valence-shell orbitals in silicon. Silicon's empty $d$ orbitals and boron's empty $p$ orbital enable tetrahedral silicon compounds and trigonal planar boron compounds to act as Lewis acids. Carbon, on the other hand, has no available valence shell orbitals; tetrahedral carbon compounds cannot act as Lewis acids. Germanium is very similar to silicon in its chemical behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Arsenic and antimony generally form compounds in which an oxidation state of $3+$ or $5+$ is exhibited; however, arsenic can form arsenides with an oxidation state of $3-$. These elements tarnish only slightly in dry air but readily oxidize when warmed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tellurium combines directly with most elements. The most stable tellurium compounds are the tellurides-salts of $\\mathrm{Te}^{3-}$ formed with active metals and lanthanides-and compounds with oxygen, fluorine, and chlorine, in which tellurium normally exhibits an oxidation state $2+$ or $4+$. Although tellurium(VI) compounds are known (for example, $\\mathrm{TeF}_{6}$ ), there is a marked resistance to oxidation to this maximum group oxidation state.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Structures of the Metalloids \n",
    "\n",
    "Covalent bonding is the key to the crystal structures of the metalloids. In this regard, these elements resemble nonmetals in their behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Elemental silicon, germanium, arsenic, antimony, and tellurium are lustrous, metallic-looking solids. Silicon and germanium crystallize with a diamond structure. Each atom within the crystal has covalent bonds to four neighboring atoms at the corners of a regular tetrahedron. Single crystals of silicon and germanium are giant, three-dimensional molecules. There are several allotropes of arsenic with the most stable being layer like and containing puckered sheets of arsenic atoms. Each arsenic atom forms covalent bonds to three other atoms within the sheet. The crystal structure of antimony is similar to that of arsenic, both shown in Figure 18.12. The structures of arsenic and antimony are similar to the structure of graphite, covered later in this chapter. Tellurium forms crystals that contain infinite spiral chains of tellurium atoms. Each atom in the chain bonds to two other atoms.\n",

    "\n",
    "Pure crystalline boron is transparent. The crystals consist of icosahedra, as shown in Figure 18.13, with a boron atom at each corner. In the most common form of boron, the icosahedra pack together in a manner similar to the cubic closest packing of spheres. All boron-boron bonds within each icosahedron are identical and are approximately 176 pm in length. In the different forms of boron, there are different arrangements and connections between the icosahedra.\n",

    "Figure 18.13 An icosahedron is a symmetrical, solid shape with 20 faces, each of which is an equilateral triangle. The faces meet at 12 corners.\n",
    "\n",
    "The name silicon is derived from the Latin word for flint, silex. The metalloid silicon readily forms compounds containing $\\mathrm{Si}-\\mathrm{O}-\\mathrm{Si}$ bonds, which are of prime importance in the mineral world. This bonding capability is in contrast to the nonmetal carbon, whose ability to form carbon-carbon bonds gives it prime importance in the plant and animal worlds.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Occurrence, Preparation, and Compounds of Boron and Silicon \n",
    "\n",
    "Boron constitutes less than $0.001 \\%$ by weight of the earth's crust. In nature, it only occurs in compounds with oxygen. Boron is widely distributed in volcanic regions as boric acid, $\\mathrm{B}(\\mathrm{OH})_{3}$, and in dry lake regions, including the desert areas of California, as borates and salts of boron oxyacids, such as borax, $\\mathrm{Na}_{2} \\mathrm{~B}_{4} \\mathrm{O}_{7} \\cdot 10 \\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Elemental boron is chemically inert at room temperature, reacting with only fluorine and oxygen to form boron trifluoride, $\\mathrm{BF}_{3}$, and boric oxide, $\\mathrm{B}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{3}$, respectively. At higher temperatures, boron reacts with all nonmetals, except tellurium and the noble gases, and with nearly all metals; it oxidizes to $\\mathrm{B}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{3}$ when heated with concentrated nitric or sulfuric acid. Boron does not react with nonoxidizing acids. Many boron compounds react readily with water to give boric acid, $\\mathrm{B}(\\mathrm{OH})_{3}$ (sometimes written as $\\mathrm{H}_{3} \\mathrm{BO}_{3}$ ).\n",

    "Silicon makes up nearly one-fourth of the mass of the earth's crust—second in abundance only to oxygen. The crust is composed almost entirely of minerals in which the silicon atoms are at the center of the silicon-oxygen tetrahedron, which connect in a variety of ways to produce, among other things, chains, layers, and three-dimensional frameworks. These minerals constitute the bulk of most common rocks, soil, and clays. In addition, materials such as bricks, ceramics, and glasses contain silicon compounds.\n",

Zone refining, illustrated in Figure 18.14, completes the purification. In this method, a rod of silicon is heated at one end by a heat source that produces a thin cross-section of molten silicon. Slowly lowering the rod through the heat source moves the molten zone from one end of the rod to other. As this thin, molten region moves, impurities in the silicon dissolve in the liquid silicon and move with the molten region. Ultimately, the impurities move to one end of the rod, which is then cut off.\n",

    "Silicon dioxide, silica, occurs in both crystalline and amorphous forms. The usual crystalline form of silicon dioxide is quartz, a hard, brittle, clear, colorless solid. It is useful in many ways-for architectural decorations, semiprecious jewels, and frequency control in radio transmitters. Silica takes many crystalline forms, or polymorphs, in nature. Trace amounts of $\\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$ in quartz give amethyst its characteristic purple color. The term quartz is also used for articles such as tubing and lenses that are manufactured from amorphous silica. Opal is a naturally occurring form of amorphous silica.\n",
    "\n",
    "The contrast in structure and physical properties between silicon dioxide and carbon dioxide is interesting, as illustrated in Figure 18.18. Solid carbon dioxide (dry ice) contains single $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ molecules with each of the two oxygen atoms attached to the carbon atom by double bonds. Very weak intermolecular forces hold the molecules together in the crystal. The volatility of dry ice reflect these weak forces between molecules. In contrast, silicon dioxide is a covalent network solid. In silicon dioxide, each silicon atom links to four oxygen atoms by single bonds directed toward the corners of a regular tetrahedron, and $\\mathrm{SiO}_{4}$ tetrahedra share oxygen atoms. This arrangement gives a three dimensional, continuous, silicon-oxygen network. A quartz crystal is a macromolecule of silicon dioxide. The difference between these two compounds is the ability of the group 14 elements to form strong $\\pi$ bonds. Secondperiod elements, such as carbon, form very strong $\\pi$ bonds, which is why carbon dioxide forms small molecules with strong double bonds. Elements below the second period, such as silicon, do not form $\\pi$ bonds as readily as secondperiod elements, and when they do form, the $\\pi$ bonds are weaker than those formed by second-period elements. For this reason, silicon dioxide does not contain $\\pi$ bonds but only $\\sigma$ bonds.\n",

The $\\mathrm{SiO}_{4}$ tetrahedra in glassy silica have a random arrangement characteristic of supercooled liquids, and the glass has some very useful properties. Silica is highly transparent to both visible and ultraviolet light. For this reason, it is important in the manufacture of lamps that give radiation rich in ultraviolet light and in certain optical instruments that operate with ultraviolet light. The coefficient of expansion of silica glass is very low; therefore, rapid temperature changes do not cause it to fracture. CorningWare and other ceramic cookware contain amorphous silica.\n",

    "Silicates are salts containing anions composed of silicon and oxygen. In nearly all silicates, $s p^{3}$-hybridized silicon atoms occur at the centers of tetrahedra with oxygen at the corners. There is a variation in the silicon-to-oxygen ratio that occurs because silicon-oxygen tetrahedra may exist as discrete, independent units or may share oxygen atoms at corners in a variety of ways. In addition, the presence of a variety of cations gives rise to the large number of silicate minerals.\n",

    "### 18.4 Structure and General Properties of the Nonmetals \n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Describe structure and properties of nonmetals\n",
    "\n",
    "The nonmetals are elements located in the upper right portion of the periodic table. Their properties and behavior are quite different from those of metals on the left side. Under normal conditions, more than half of the nonmetals are gases, one is a liquid, and the rest include some of the softest and hardest of solids. The nonmetals exhibit a rich variety of chemical behaviors. They include the most reactive and least reactive of elements, and they form many different ionic and covalent compounds. This section presents an overview of the properties and chemical behaviors of the nonmetals, as well as the chemistry of specific elements. Many of these nonmetals are important in biological systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "In many cases, trends in electronegativity enable us to predict the type of bonding and the physical states in compounds involving the nonmetals. We know that electronegativity decreases as we move down a given group and increases as we move from left to right across a period. The nonmetals have higher electronegativities than do metals, and compounds formed between metals and nonmetals are generally ionic in nature because of the large differences in electronegativity between them. The metals form cations, the nonmetals form anions, and the resulting compounds are solids under normal conditions. On the other hand, compounds formed between two or more nonmetals have small differences in electronegativity between the atoms, and covalent bonding-sharing of electrons-results. These substances tend to be molecular in nature and are gases, liquids, or volatile solids at room temperature and pressure.\n",
    "\n",
    "In normal chemical processes, nonmetals do not form monatomic positive ions (cations) because their ionization energies are too high. All monatomic nonmetal ions are anions; examples include the chloride ion, $\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$, the nitride ion, $\\mathrm{N}^{3-}$, and the selenide ion, $\\mathrm{Se}^{2-}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The common oxidation states that the nonmetals exhibit in their ionic and covalent compounds are shown in Figure 18.19. Remember that an element exhibits a positive oxidation state when combined with a more electronegative element and that it exhibits a negative oxidation state when combined with a less electronegative element.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Image](Chapter_18_images/img-19.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 18.19 Nonmetals exhibit these common oxidation states in ionic and covalent compounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first member of each nonmetal group exhibits different behaviors, in many respects, from the other group members. The reasons for this include smaller size, greater ionization energy, and (most important) the fact that the first member of each group has only four valence orbitals (one $2 s$ and three $2 p$ ) available for bonding, whereas other group members have empty $d$ orbitals in their valence shells, making possible five, six, or even more bonds around the central atom. For example, nitrogen forms only $\\mathrm{NF}_{3}$, whereas phosphorus forms both $\\mathrm{PF}_{3}$ and $\\mathrm{PF}_{5}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another difference between the first group member and subsequent members is the greater ability of the first member to form $\\pi$ bonds. This is primarily a function of the smaller size of the first member of each group, which allows better overlap of atomic orbitals. Nonmetals, other than the first member of each group, rarely form $\\pi$ bonds to nonmetals that are the first member of a group. For example, sulfur-oxygen $\\pi$ bonds are well known, whereas sulfur does not normally form stable $\\pi$ bonds to itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "The variety of oxidation states displayed by most of the nonmetals means that many of their chemical reactions\n",
    "\n",
    "involve changes in oxidation state through oxidation-reduction reactions. There are five general aspects of the oxidation-reduction chemistry:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Nonmetals oxidize most metals. The oxidation state of the metal becomes positive as it undergoes oxidation and that of the nonmetal becomes negative as it undergoes reduction. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{array}{ccc}\n",
    "4 \\mathrm{Fe}(s)+ & 3 \\mathrm{O}_{2}(g) & \\longrightarrow & 2 \\mathrm{Fe}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{3}(s) \\\\\n",
    "0 & 0 & & +3-2\n",
    "\\end{array}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. With the exception of nitrogen and carbon, which are poor oxidizing agents, a more electronegative nonmetal oxidizes a less electronegative nonmetal or the anion of the nonmetal:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{array}{ccc}\n",
    "\\mathrm{S}(s)+\\mathrm{O}_{2}(g) & \\longrightarrow & 2 \\mathrm{SO}_{2}(s) \\\\\n",
    "0 & 0 & +4-2 \\\\\n",
    "\\mathrm{Cl}_{2}(g)+2 \\mathrm{I}^{-}(a q) & \\longrightarrow & \\mathrm{I}_{2}(s)+2 \\mathrm{Cl}^{-}(a q) \\\\\n",
    "0 & 0 &\n",
    "\\end{array}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Fluorine and oxygen are the strongest oxidizing agents within their respective groups; each oxidizes all the elements that lie below it in the group. Within any period, the strongest oxidizing agent is in group 17. A nonmetal often oxidizes an element that lies to its left in the same period. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "& 2 \\mathrm{As}(s)+3 \\mathrm{Br}_{2}(l) \\longrightarrow 2 \\mathrm{AsBr}_{3}(s) \\\\\n",
    "& 0 \\quad 0 \\quad+3-1\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The stronger a nonmetal is as an oxidizing agent, the more difficult it is to oxidize the anion formed by the nonmetal. This means that the most stable negative ions are formed by elements at the top of the group or in group 17 of the period.\n",
    "5. Fluorine and oxygen are the strongest oxidizing elements known. Fluorine does not form compounds in which it exhibits positive oxidation states; oxygen exhibits a positive oxidation state only when combined with fluorine. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{array}{cc}\n",
    "2 \\mathrm{~F}_{2}(g)+2 \\mathrm{OH}^{-}(a q) \\longrightarrow & \\mathrm{OF}_{2}(g)+2 \\mathrm{~F}^{-}(a q)+\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}(l) \\\\\n",
    "0 & +2-1\n",
    "\\end{array}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "With the exception of most of the noble gases, all nonmetals form compounds with oxygen, yielding covalent oxides. Most of these oxides are acidic, that is, they react with water to form oxyacids. Recall from the acid-base chapter that an oxyacid is an acid consisting of hydrogen, oxygen, and some other element. Notable exceptions are carbon monoxide, CO, nitrous oxide, $\\mathrm{N}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$, and nitric oxide, NO. There are three characteristics of these acidic oxides:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Oxides such as $\\mathrm{SO}_{2}$ and $\\mathrm{N}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{5}$, in which the nonmetal exhibits one of its common oxidation states, are acid anhydrides and react with water to form acids with no change in oxidation state. The product is an oxyacid. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "\\mathrm{SO}_{2}(g)+\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}(l) & \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{SO}_{3}(a q) \\\\\n",
    "\\mathrm{N}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{5}(s)+\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}(l) & \\longrightarrow 2 \\mathrm{HNO}_{3}(a q)\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Those oxides such as $\\mathrm{NO}_{2}$ and $\\mathrm{ClO}_{2}$, in which the nonmetal does not exhibit one of its common oxidation states, also react with water. In these reactions, the nonmetal is both oxidized and reduced. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{array}{ll}\n",
    "3 \\mathrm{NO}_{2}(g)+\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}(l) \\longrightarrow & 2 \\mathrm{HNO}_{3}(a q)+ \\\\\n",
    "+4 & +5\n",
    "\\end{array}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Reactions in which the same element is both oxidized and reduced are called disproportionation reactions.\n",
    "3. The acid strength increases as the electronegativity of the central atom increases. To learn more, see the discussion in the chapter on acid-base chemistry.\n",
    "\n",
    "The binary hydrogen compounds of the nonmetals also exhibit an acidic behavior in water, although only $\\mathrm{HCl}, \\mathrm{HBr}$, and HI are strong acids. The acid strength of the nonmetal hydrogen compounds increases from left to right across a period and down a group. For example, ammonia, $\\mathrm{NH}_{3}$, is a weaker acid than is water, $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$, which is weaker than\n",
    "\n",
    "is hydrogen fluoride, HF. Water, $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$, is also a weaker acid than is hydrogen sulfide, $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{~S}_{2}$ which is weaker than is hydrogen selenide, $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{Se}$. Weaker acidic character implies greater basic character.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Structures of the Nonmetals \n",
    "\n",
    "The structures of the nonmetals differ dramatically from those of metals. Metals crystallize in closely packed arrays that do not contain molecules or covalent bonds. Nonmetal structures contain covalent bonds, and many nonmetals consist of individual molecules. The electrons in nonmetals are localized in covalent bonds, whereas in a metal, there is delocalization of the electrons throughout the solid.\n",
    "\n",
    "The noble gases are all monatomic, whereas the other nonmetal gases-hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, and chlorine-normally exist as the diatomic molecules $\\mathrm{H}_{2}, \\mathrm{~N}_{2}, \\mathrm{O}_{2}, \\mathrm{~F}_{2}$, and $\\mathrm{Cl}_{2}$. The other halogens are also diatomic; $\\mathrm{Br}_{2}$ is a liquid and $\\mathrm{I}_{2}$ exists as a solid under normal conditions. The changes in state as one moves down the halogen family offer excellent examples of the increasing strength of intermolecular London forces with increasing molecular mass and increasing polarizability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Oxygen has two allotropes: $\\mathrm{O}_{2}$, dioxygen, and $\\mathrm{O}_{3}$, ozone. Phosphorus has three common allotropes, commonly referred to by their colors: white, red, and black. Sulfur has several allotropes. There are also many carbon allotropes. Most people know of diamond, graphite, and charcoal, but fewer people know of the recent discovery of fullerenes, carbon nanotubes, and graphene.\n",
    "\n",
    "Descriptions of the physical properties of three nonmetals that are characteristic of molecular solids follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Carbon\n",
    "\n",
    "Carbon occurs in the uncombined (elemental) state in many forms, such as diamond, graphite, charcoal, coke, carbon black, graphene, and fullerene.\n",
    "\n",
    "Diamond, shown in Figure 18.20, is a very hard crystalline material that is colorless and transparent when pure. Each atom forms four single bonds to four other atoms at the corners of a tetrahedron ( $s p^{3}$ hybridization); this makes the diamond a giant molecule. Carbon-carbon single bonds are very strong, and, because they extend throughout the crystal to form a three-dimensional network, the crystals are very hard and have high melting points $\\left(\\sim 4400^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}\\right)$.\n",

    "Graphite, also shown in Figure 18.20, is a soft, slippery, grayish-black solid that conducts electricity. These properties relate to its structure, which consists of layers of carbon atoms, with each atom surrounded by three other carbon atoms in a trigonal planar arrangement. Each carbon atom in graphite forms three $\\sigma$ bonds, one to each of its nearest neighbors, by means of $s p^{2}$-hybrid orbitals. The unhybridized $p$ orbital on each carbon atom will overlap unhybridized orbitals on adjacent carbon atoms in the same layer to form $\\pi$ bonds. Many resonance forms are\n",

    "necessary to describe the electronic structure of a graphite layer; Figure $\\mathbf{1 8 . 2 1}$ illustrates two of these forms.\n",

    "\n",
    "Atoms within a graphite layer are bonded together tightly by the $\\sigma$ and $\\pi$ bonds; however, the forces between layers are weak. London dispersion forces hold the layers together. To learn more, see the discussion of these weak forces in the chapter on liquids and solids. The weak forces between layers give graphite the soft, flaky character that makes it useful as the so-called \"lead\" in pencils and the slippery character that makes it useful as a lubricant. The loosely held electrons in the resonating $\\pi$ bonds can move throughout the solid and are responsible for the electrical conductivity of graphite.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other forms of elemental carbon include carbon black, charcoal, and coke. Carbon black is an amorphous form of carbon prepared by the incomplete combustion of natural gas, $\\mathrm{CH}_{4}$. It is possible to produce charcoal and coke by heating wood and coal, respectively, at high temperatures in the absence of air.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recently, new forms of elemental carbon molecules have been identified in the soot generated by a smoky flame and in the vapor produced when graphite is heated to very high temperatures in a vacuum or in helium. One of these new forms, first isolated by Professor Richard Smalley and coworkers at Rice University, consists of icosahedral (soccer-ball-shaped) molecules that contain 60 carbon atoms, $\\mathrm{C}_{60}$. This is buckminsterfullerene (often called bucky balls) after the architect Buckminster Fuller, who designed domed structures, which have a similar appearance (Figure 18.22).\n",

    "**Nanotubes and Graphene**\n",
    "\n",
    "Graphene and carbon nanotubes are two recently discovered allotropes of carbon. Both of the forms bear some relationship to graphite. Graphene is a single layer of graphite (one atom thick), as illustrated in Figure 18.23, whereas carbon nanotubes roll the layer into a small tube, as illustrated in Figure 18.23.\n",

    "\n",
    "Graphene is a very strong, lightweight, and efficient conductor of heat and electricity discovered in 2003. As in graphite, the carbon atoms form a layer of six-membered rings with $s p^{2}$-hybridized carbon atoms at the corners. Resonance stabilizes the system and leads to its conductivity. Unlike graphite, there is no stacking of the layers to give a three-dimensional structure. Andre Geim and Kostya Novoselov at the University of Manchester won the 2010 Nobel Prize in Physics for their pioneering work characterizing graphene.\n",
    "The simplest procedure for preparing graphene is to use a piece of adhesive tape to remove a single layer of graphene from the surface of a piece of graphite. This method works because there are only weak London dispersion forces between the layers in graphite. Alternative methods are to deposit a single layer of carbon atoms on the surface of some other material (ruthenium, iridium, or copper) or to synthesize it at the surface of silicon carbide via the sublimation of silicon.\n",
    "There currently are no commercial applications of graphene. However, its unusual properties, such as high electron mobility and thermal conductivity, should make it suitable for the manufacture of many advanced electronic devices and for thermal management applications.\n",
    "Carbon nanotubes are carbon allotropes, which have a cylindrical structure. Like graphite and graphene, nanotubes consist of rings of $s p^{2}$-hybridized carbon atoms. Unlike graphite and graphene, which occur in layers, the layers wrap into a tube and bond together to produce a stable structure. The walls of the tube may be one atom or multiple atoms thick.\n",
    "Carbon nanotubes are extremely strong materials that are harder than diamond. Depending upon the shape of the nanotube, it may be a conductor or semiconductor. For some applications, the conducting form is preferable, whereas other applications utilize the semiconducting form.\n",
    "The basis for the synthesis of carbon nanotubes is the generation of carbon atoms in a vacuum. It is possible to produce carbon atoms by an electrical discharge through graphite, vaporization of graphite with a laser, and the decomposition of a carbon compound.\n",
    "The strength of carbon nanotubes will eventually lead to some of their most exciting applications, as a thread produced from several nanotubes will support enormous weight. However, the current applications only employ bulk nanotubes. The addition of nanotubes to polymers improves the mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties of the bulk material. There are currently nanotubes in some bicycle parts, skis, baseball bats, fishing rods, and surfboards.\n",

    "#### Phosphorus \n",
    "\n",
    "The name phosphorus comes from the Greek words meaning light bringing. When phosphorus was first isolated, scientists noted that it glowed in the dark and burned when exposed to air. Phosphorus is the only member of its group that does not occur in the uncombined state in nature; it exists in many allotropic forms. We will consider two of those forms: white phosphorus and red phosphorus.\n",
    "White phosphorus is a white, waxy solid that melts at $44.2^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ and boils at $280^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$. It is insoluble in water (in which it is stored—see Figure 18.24), is very soluble in carbon disulfide, and bursts into flame in air. As a solid, as a liquid, as a gas, and in solution, white phosphorus exists as $\\mathrm{P}_{4}$ molecules with four phosphorus atoms at the corners of a regular tetrahedron, as illustrated in Figure 18.24. Each phosphorus atom covalently bonds to the other three atoms in the molecule by single covalent bonds. White phosphorus is the most reactive allotrope and is very toxic.\n",

    "Heating white phosphorus to $270-300^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ in the absence of air yields red phosphorus. Red phosphorus (shown in Figure 18.24) is denser, has a higher melting point $\\left(\\sim 600^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}\\right)$, is much less reactive, is essentially nontoxic, and is easier and safer to handle than is white phosphorus. Its structure is highly polymeric and appears to contain threedimensional networks of $\\mathrm{P}_{4}$ tetrahedra joined by $\\mathrm{P}-\\mathrm{P}$ single bonds. Red phosphorus is insoluble in solvents that dissolve white phosphorus. When red phosphorus is heated, $\\mathrm{P}_{4}$ molecules sublime from the solid.\n",

    "The allotropy of sulfur is far greater and more complex than that of any other element. Sulfur is the brimstone referred to in the Bible and other places, and references to sulfur occur throughout recorded history-right up to the relatively recent discovery that it is a component of the atmospheres of Venus and of Io, a moon of Jupiter. The most common and most stable allotrope of sulfur is yellow, rhombic sulfur, so named because of the shape of its crystals. Rhombic sulfur is the form to which all other allotropes revert at room temperature. Crystals of rhombic sulfur melt at $113^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$. Cooling this liquid gives long needles of monoclinic sulfur. This form is stable from $96^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ to the melting point, 119 ${ }^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$. At room temperature, it gradually reverts to the rhombic form.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both rhombic sulfur and monoclinic sulfur contain $\\mathrm{S}_{8}$ molecules in which atoms form eight-membered, puckered rings that resemble crowns, as illustrated in Figure 18.25. Each sulfur atom is bonded to each of its two neighbors in the ring by covalent S-S single bonds.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Image](Chapter_18_images/img-25.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 18.25 These four sulfur allotropes show eight-membered, puckered rings. Each sulfur atom bonds to each of its two neighbors in the ring by covalent S-S single bonds. Here are (a) individual $\\mathrm{S}_{8}$ rings, (b) $\\mathrm{S}_{8}$ chains formed when the rings open, (c) longer chains formed by adding sulfur atoms to $\\mathrm{S}_{8}$ chains, and (d) part of the very long sulfur chains formed at higher temperatures.\n",
    "\n",
    "When rhombic sulfur melts, the straw-colored liquid is quite mobile; its viscosity is low because $\\mathrm{S}_{8}$ molecules are essentially spherical and offer relatively little resistance as they move past each other. As the temperature rises, S-S bonds in the rings break, and polymeric chains of sulfur atoms result. These chains combine end to end, forming still longer chains that tangle with one another. The liquid gradually darkens in color and becomes so viscous that finally (at about $230^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ ) it does not pour easily. The dangling atoms at the ends of the chains of sulfur atoms are responsible for the dark red color because their electronic structure differs from those of sulfur atoms that have bonds to two adjacent sulfur atoms. This causes them to absorb light differently and results in a different visible color. Cooling the liquid rapidly produces a rubberlike amorphous mass, called plastic sulfur.\n",
    "Sulfur boils at $445^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ and forms a vapor consisting of $\\mathrm{S}_{2}, \\mathrm{~S}_{6}$, and $\\mathrm{S}_{8}$ molecules; at about $1000^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$, the vapor density corresponds to the formula $\\mathrm{S}_{2}$, which is a paramagnetic molecule like $\\mathrm{O}_{2}$ with a similar electronic structure and a weak sulfur-sulfur double bond.\n",
    "\n",
    "As seen in this discussion, an important feature of the structural behavior of the nonmetals is that the elements usually occur with eight electrons in their valence shells. If necessary, the elements form enough covalent bonds to supplement the electrons already present to possess an octet. For example, members of group 15 have five valence electrons and require only three additional electrons to fill their valence shells. These elements form three covalent bonds in their free state: triple bonds in the $\\mathrm{N}_{2}$ molecule or single bonds to three different atoms in arsenic and phosphorus. The elements of group 16 require only two additional electrons. Oxygen forms a double bond in the $\\mathrm{O}_{2}$ molecule, and sulfur, selenium, and tellurium form two single bonds in various rings and chains. The halogens form diatomic molecules in which each atom is involved in only one bond. This provides the electron required necessary to complete the octet on the halogen atom. The noble gases do not form covalent bonds to other noble gas atoms because they already have a filled outer shell.\n",

    "### 18.5 Occurrence, Preparation, and Compounds of Hydrogen \n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Describe the properties, preparation, and compounds of hydrogen\n",
    "\n",
    "Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe. The sun and other stars are composed largely of hydrogen. Astronomers estimate that $90 \\%$ of the atoms in the universe are hydrogen atoms. Hydrogen is a component of more compounds than any other element. Water is the most abundant compound of hydrogen found on earth. Hydrogen is an important part of petroleum, many minerals, cellulose and starch, sugar, fats, oils, alcohols, acids, and thousands of other substances.\n",
    "\n",
    "At ordinary temperatures, hydrogen is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, and nonpoisonous gas consisting of the diatomic molecule $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$. Hydrogen is composed of three isotopes, and unlike other elements, these isotopes have different names and chemical symbols: protium, ${ }^{1} \\mathrm{H}$, deuterium, ${ }^{2} \\mathrm{H}$ (or \" D \"), and tritium ${ }^{3} \\mathrm{H}$ (or \" T \"). In a naturally occurring sample of hydrogen, there is one atom of deuterium for every 7000 H atoms and one atom of radioactive tritium for every $10^{18} \\mathrm{H}$ atoms. The chemical properties of the different isotopes are very similar because they have identical electron structures, but they differ in some physical properties because of their differing atomic masses. Elemental deuterium and tritium have lower vapor pressure than ordinary hydrogen. Consequently, when liquid hydrogen evaporates, the heavier isotopes are concentrated in the last portions to evaporate. Electrolysis of heavy water, $\\mathrm{D}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$, yields deuterium. Most tritium originates from nuclear reactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Preparation of Hydrogen\n",
    "\n",
    "Elemental hydrogen must be prepared from compounds by breaking chemical bonds. The most common methods of preparing hydrogen follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### From Steam and Carbon or Hydrocarbons\n",
    "\n",
    "Water is the cheapest and most abundant source of hydrogen. Passing steam over coke (an impure form of elemental carbon) at $1000^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ produces a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen known as water gas:\n",
    "\n",
    "Water gas is as an industrial fuel. It is possible to produce additional hydrogen by mixing the water gas with steam in the presence of a catalyst to convert the CO to $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. This reaction is the water gas shift reaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also possible to prepare a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide by passing hydrocarbons from natural gas or petroleum and steam over a nickel-based catalyst. Propane is an example of a hydrocarbon reactant:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Electrolysis \n",
    "\n",
    "Hydrogen forms when direct current electricity passes through water containing an electrolyte such as $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{SO}_{4}$, as illustrated in Figure 18.26. Bubbles of hydrogen form at the cathode, and oxygen evolves at the anode. The net reaction is:\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Reaction of Metals with Acids\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the most convenient laboratory method of producing hydrogen. Metals with lower reduction potentials reduce the hydrogen ion in dilute acids to produce hydrogen gas and metal salts. For example, as shown in Figure 18.27, iron in dilute hydrochloric acid produces hydrogen gas and iron(II) chloride:\n",

    "\n",
    "Metal hydrides are expensive but convenient sources of hydrogen, especially where space and weight are important factors. They are important in the inflation of life jackets, life rafts, and military balloons.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reactions\n",
    "\n",
    "Under normal conditions, hydrogen is relatively inactive chemically, but when heated, it enters into many chemical reactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two thirds of the world's hydrogen production is devoted to the manufacture of ammonia, which is a fertilizer and used in the manufacture of nitric acid. Large quantities of hydrogen are also important in the process of hydrogenation, discussed in the chapter on organic chemistry.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to use hydrogen as a nonpolluting fuel. The reaction of hydrogen with oxygen is a very exothermic reaction, releasing 286 kJ of energy per mole of water formed. Hydrogen burns without explosion under controlled conditions. The oxygen-hydrogen torch, because of the high heat of combustion of hydrogen, can achieve temperatures up to $2800{ }^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$. The hot flame of this torch is useful in cutting thick sheets of many metals. Liquid hydrogen is also an important rocket fuel (Figure 18.28).\n",

    "Figure 18.28 Before the fleet's retirement in 2011, liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen were used in the three main engines of a space shuttle. Two compartments in the large tank held these liquids until the shuttle was launched. (credit: \"reynermedia\"/Flickr)\n",
    "\n",
    "An uncombined hydrogen atom consists of a nucleus and one valence electron in the 1 s orbital. The $n=1$ valence shell has a capacity for two electrons, and hydrogen can rightfully occupy two locations in the periodic table. It is possible to consider hydrogen a group 1 element because hydrogen can lose an electron to form the cation, $\\mathrm{H}^{+}$. It is also possible to consider hydrogen to be a group 17 element because it needs only one electron to fill its valence orbital to form a hydride ion, $\\mathrm{H}^{-}$, or it can share an electron to form a single, covalent bond. In reality, hydrogen is a unique element that almost deserves its own location in the periodic table.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reactions with Elements \n",
    "\n",
    "When heated, hydrogen reacts with the metals of group 1 and with $\\mathrm{Ca}, \\mathrm{Sr}$, and Ba (the more active metals in group 2). The compounds formed are crystalline, ionic hydrides that contain the hydride anion, $\\mathrm{H}^{-}$, a strong reducing agent and a strong base, which reacts vigorously with water and other acids to form hydrogen gas.\n",
    "The reactions of hydrogen with nonmetals generally produce acidic hydrogen compounds with hydrogen in the $1+$ oxidation state. The reactions become more exothermic and vigorous as the electronegativity of the nonmetal increases. Hydrogen reacts with nitrogen and sulfur only when heated, but it reacts explosively with fluorine (forming HF ) and, under some conditions, with chlorine (forming HCl ). A mixture of hydrogen and oxygen explodes if ignited. Because of the explosive nature of the reaction, it is necessary to exercise caution when handling hydrogen (or any other combustible gas) to avoid the formation of an explosive mixture in a confined space. Although most hydrides of the nonmetals are acidic, ammonia and phosphine $\\left(\\mathrm{PH}_{3}\\right)$ are very, very weak acids and generally function as bases.

    "Most pure nitrogen comes from the fractional distillation of liquid air. The atmosphere consists of $78 \\%$ nitrogen by volume. This means there are more than 20 million tons of nitrogen over every square mile of the earth's surface. Nitrogen is a component of proteins and of the genetic material (DNA/RNA) of all plants and animals.\n",

    "Under ordinary conditions, nitrogen is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas. It boils at 77 K and freezes at 63 K . Liquid nitrogen is a useful coolant because it is inexpensive and has a low boiling point. Nitrogen is very unreactive because of the very strong triple bond between the nitrogen atoms. The only common reactions at room temperature occur with lithium to form $\\mathrm{Li}_{3} \\mathrm{~N}$, with certain transition metal complexes, and with hydrogen or oxygen in nitrogenfixing bacteria. The general lack of reactivity of nitrogen makes the remarkable ability of some bacteria to synthesize nitrogen compounds using atmospheric nitrogen gas as the source one of the most exciting chemical events on our planet. This process is one type of nitrogen fixation. In this case, nitrogen fixation is the process where organisms convert atmospheric nitrogen into biologically useful chemicals.

Atmospheric nitrogen consists of $\\mathrm{N}_{2}$ molecules, which are very unreactive due to the strong nitrogen-nitrogen triple bond. However, a few organisms can overcome this problem through a process known as nitrogen fixation, illustrated in Figure 18.32 .\n",

    "Nitrogen fixation is the process where organisms convert atmospheric nitrogen into biologically useful chemicals. To date, the only known kind of biological organisms capable of nitrogen fixation are\n",

    "Large volumes of atmospheric nitrogen are necessary for making ammonia-the principal starting material used for preparation of large quantities of other nitrogen-containing compounds. Most other uses for elemental nitrogen depend on its inactivity. It is helpful when a chemical process requires an inert atmosphere. Canned foods and luncheon meats cannot oxidize in a pure nitrogen atmosphere, so they retain a better flavor and color, and spoil less rapidly, when sealed in nitrogen instead of air. This technology allows fresh produce to be available year-round, regardless of growing season.\n",

    "There are compounds with nitrogen in all of its oxidation states from 3- to 5+. Much of the chemistry of nitrogen involves oxidation-reduction reactions. Some active metals (such as alkali metals and alkaline earth metals) can reduce nitrogen to form metal nitrides. In the remainder of this section, we will examine nitrogen-oxygen chemistry.\n",

    "There are well-characterized nitrogen oxides in which nitrogen exhibits each of its positive oxidation numbers from $1+$ to $5+$.

No one should ever attempt this reaction-it can be very explosive. In 1947, there was a major ammonium nitrate explosion in Texas City, Texas, and, in 2013, there was another major explosion in West, Texas. In the last 100 years, there were nearly 30 similar disasters worldwide, resulting in the loss of numerous lives. In this oxidation-reduction reaction, the nitrogen in the nitrate ion oxidizes the nitrogen in the ammonium ion.

    "### 18.9 Occurrence, Preparation, and Compounds of Oxygen \n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Describe the properties, preparation, and compounds of oxygen\n",
    "- Describe the preparation, properties, and uses of some representative metal oxides, peroxides, and hydroxides\n",
    "\n",
    "Oxygen is the most abundant element on the earth's crust. The earth's surface is composed of the crust, atmosphere, and hydrosphere. About $50 \\%$ of the mass of the earth's crust consists of oxygen (combined with other elements, principally silicon). Oxygen occurs as $\\mathrm{O}_{2}$ molecules and, to a limited extent, as $\\mathrm{O}_{3}$ (ozone) molecules in air. It forms about $20 \\%$ of the mass of the air. About $89 \\%$ of water by mass consists of combined oxygen. In combination with carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen, oxygen is a large part of plants and animals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Oxygen is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas at ordinary temperatures. It is slightly denser than air. Although it is only slightly soluble in water ( 49 mL of gas dissolves in 1 L at STP), oxygen's solubility is very important to aquatic life.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the oxygen isolated commercially comes from air and the remainder from the electrolysis of water. The separation of oxygen from air begins with cooling and compressing the air until it liquefies. As liquid air warms, oxygen with its higher boiling point ( 90 K ) separates from nitrogen, which has a lower boiling point ( 77 K ). It is possible to separate the other components of air at the same time based on differences in their boiling points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Oxygen is essential in combustion processes such as the burning of fuels. Plants and animals use the oxygen from the air in respiration. The administration of oxygen-enriched air is an important medical practice when a patient is receiving an inadequate supply of oxygen because of shock, pneumonia, or some other illness.\n",
    "\n",
    "The chemical industry employs oxygen for oxidizing many substances. A significant amount of oxygen produced commercially is important in the removal of carbon from iron during steel production. Large quantities of pure oxygen are also necessary in metal fabrication and in the cutting and welding of metals with oxyhydrogen and oxyacetylene torches.\n",
    "\n",
    "Liquid oxygen is important to the space industry. It is an oxidizing agent in rocket engines. It is also the source of gaseous oxygen for life support in space.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we know, oxygen is very important to life. The energy required for the maintenance of normal body functions in human beings and in other organisms comes from the slow oxidation of chemical compounds. Oxygen is the final oxidizing agent in these reactions. In humans, oxygen passes from the lungs into the blood, where it combines with hemoglobin, producing oxyhemoglobin. In this form, blood transports the oxygen to tissues, where it is transferred to the tissues. The ultimate products are carbon dioxide and water. The blood carries the carbon dioxide through the veins to the lungs, where the blood releases the carbon dioxide and collects another supply of oxygen. Digestion and assimilation of food regenerate the materials consumed by oxidation in the body; the energy liberated is the same as if the food burned outside the body.\n",
    "\n",
    "Green plants continually replenish the oxygen in the atmosphere by a process called photosynthesis. The products of photosynthesis may vary, but, in general, the process converts carbon dioxide and water into glucose (a sugar) and oxygen using the energy of light:\n",

    "When dry oxygen is passed between two electrically charged plates, ozone $\\left(\\mathrm{O}_{3}\\right.$, illustrated in Figure 18.42), an allotrope of oxygen possessing a distinctive odor, forms. The formation of ozone from oxygen is an endothermic reaction, in which the energy comes from an electrical discharge, heat, or ultraviolet light:\n",

    "Figure 18.42 The image shows the bent ozone $\\left(\\mathrm{O}_{3}\\right)$ molecule and the resonance structures necessary to describe its bonding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ozone forms naturally in the upper atmosphere by the action of ultraviolet light from the sun on the oxygen there. Most atmospheric ozone occurs in the stratosphere, a layer of the atmosphere extending from about 10 to 50 kilometers above the earth's surface. This ozone acts as a barrier to harmful ultraviolet light from the sun by absorbing it via a chemical decomposition reaction:\n",

    "\n",
    "The reactive oxygen atoms recombine with molecular oxygen to complete the ozone cycle. The presence of stratospheric ozone decreases the frequency of skin cancer and other damaging effects of ultraviolet radiation. It has been clearly demonstrated that chlorofluorocarbons, CFCs (known commercially as Freons), which were present as aerosol propellants in spray cans and as refrigerants, caused depletion of ozone in the stratosphere. This occurred because ultraviolet light also causes CFCs to decompose, producing atomic chlorine. The chlorine atoms react with ozone molecules, resulting in a net removal of $\\mathrm{O}_{3}$ molecules from stratosphere. This process is explored in detail in our coverage of chemical kinetics. There is a worldwide effort to reduce the amount of CFCs used commercially, and the ozone hole is already beginning to decrease in size as atmospheric concentrations of atomic chlorine decrease. While ozone in the stratosphere helps protect us, ozone in the troposphere is a problem. This ozone is a toxic component of photochemical smog.\n",
    "The uses of ozone depend on its reactivity with other substances. It can be used as a bleaching agent for oils, waxes, fabrics, and starch: It oxidizes the colored compounds in these substances to colorless compounds. It is an alternative to chlorine as a disinfectant for water.\n",

    "\n",
    "Oxygen reacts directly at room temperature or at elevated temperatures with all other elements except the noble gases, the halogens, and few second- and third-row transition metals of low reactivity (those with higher reduction potentials than copper). Rust is an example of the reaction of oxygen with iron. The more active metals form peroxides or superoxides. Less active metals and the nonmetals give oxides. Two examples of these reactions are:\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Reaction with Compounds\n",
    "\n",
    "Elemental oxygen also reacts with some compounds. If it is possible to oxidize any of the elements in a given compound, further oxidation by oxygen can occur. For example, hydrogen sulfide, $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{~S}$, contains sulfur with an oxidation state of $2-$. Because the sulfur does not exhibit its maximum oxidation state, we would expect $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{~S}$ to react with oxygen. It does, yielding water and sulfur dioxide. The reaction is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also possible to oxidize oxides such as CO and $\\mathrm{P}_{4} \\mathrm{O}_{6}$ that contain an element with a lower oxidation state. The ease with which elemental oxygen picks up electrons is mirrored by the difficulty of removing electrons from oxygen in most oxides. Of the elements, only the very reactive fluorine can oxidize oxides to form oxygen gas.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Oxides, Peroxides, and Hydroxides\n",
    "\n",
    "Compounds of the representative metals with oxygen fall into three categories: (1) oxides, containing oxide ions, $\\mathrm{O}^{2-}$; (2) peroxides, containing peroxides ions, $\\mathrm{O}_{2}{ }^{2-}$, with oxygen-oxygen covalent single bonds and a very limited number of superoxides, containing superoxide ions, $\\mathrm{O}_{2}{ }^{-}$, with oxygen-oxygen covalent bonds that have a bond order of $1 \\frac{1}{2}$. In addition, there are (3) hydroxides, containing hydroxide ions, $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$. All representative metals form oxides. Some of the metals of group 2 also form peroxides, $\\mathrm{MO}_{2}$, and the metals of group 1 also form peroxides, $\\mathrm{M}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{2}$, and superoxides, $\\mathrm{MO}_{2}$.\n",

These elements are too reactive to occur freely in nature, but their compounds are widely distributed. Chlorides are the most abundant; although fluorides, bromides, and iodides are less common, they are reasonably available. In this section, we will examine the occurrence, preparation, and properties of halogens. Next, we will examine halogen compounds with the representative metals followed by an examination of the interhalogens. This section will conclude with some applications of halogens.\n",

    "All of the halogens occur in seawater as halide ions. The concentration of the chloride ion is 0.54 M ; that of the other halides is less than $10^{-4} \\mathrm{M}$. Fluoride also occurs in minerals such as $\\mathrm{CaF}_{2}, \\mathrm{Ca}\\left(\\mathrm{PO}_{4}\\right)_{3} \\mathrm{~F}$, and $\\mathrm{Na}_{3} \\mathrm{AlF}_{6}$. Chloride also occurs in the Great Salt Lake and the Dead Sea, and in extensive salt beds that contain $\\mathrm{NaCl}, \\mathrm{KCl}$, or $\\mathrm{MgCl}_{2}$. Part of the chlorine in your body is present as hydrochloric acid, which is a component of stomach acid. Bromine compounds occur in the Dead Sea and underground brines. Iodine compounds are found in small quantities in Chile saltpeter, underground brines, and sea kelp. Iodine is essential to the function of the thyroid gland.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best sources of halogens (except iodine) are halide salts. It is possible to oxidize the halide ions to free diatomic halogen molecules by various methods, depending on the ease of oxidation of the halide ion. Fluoride is the most difficult to oxidize, whereas iodide is the easiest.\n",
    "\n",
    "The major method for preparing fluorine is electrolytic oxidation. The most common electrolysis procedure is to use a molten mixture of potassium hydrogen fluoride, $\\mathrm{KHF}_{2}$, and anhydrous hydrogen fluoride. Electrolysis causes HF to decompose, forming fluorine gas at the anode and hydrogen at the cathode. It is necessary to keep the two gases separated to prevent their explosive recombination to reform hydrogen fluoride.\n",

In 1962, Dr. Neil Bartlett at the University of British Columbia proved this assumption to be false.\n",
    "\n",
    "These elements are present in the atmosphere in small amounts. Some natural gas contains 1-2\\% helium by mass. Helium is isolated from natural gas by liquefying the condensable components, leaving only helium as a gas. The United States possesses most of the world's commercial supply of this element in its helium-bearing gas fields. Argon, neon, krypton, and xenon come from the fractional distillation of liquid air. Radon comes from other radioactive elements. More recently, it was observed that this radioactive gas is present in very small amounts in soils and minerals. Its accumulation in well-insulated, tightly sealed buildings, however, constitutes a health hazard, primarily lung cancer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The boiling points and melting points of the noble gases are extremely low relative to those of other substances of comparable atomic or molecular masses. This is because only weak London dispersion forces are present, and these forces can hold the atoms together only when molecular motion is very slight, as it is at very low temperatures. Helium is the only substance known that does not solidify on cooling at normal pressure. It remains liquid close to absolute zero $(0.001 \\mathrm{~K})$ at ordinary pressures, but it solidifies under elevated pressure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Helium is used for filling balloons and lighter-than-air craft because it does not burn, making it safer to use than hydrogen. Helium at high pressures is not a narcotic like nitrogen. Thus, mixtures of oxygen and helium are important for divers working under high pressures. Using a helium-oxygen mixture avoids the disoriented mental state known as nitrogen narcosis, the so-called rapture of the deep. Helium is important as an inert atmosphere for the melting and welding of easily oxidizable metals and for many chemical processes that are sensitive to air.\n",
    "\n",
    "Liquid helium (boiling point, 4.2 K ) is an important coolant to reach the low temperatures necessary for cryogenic research, and it is essential for achieving the low temperatures necessary to produce superconduction in traditional superconducting materials used in powerful magnets and other devices. This cooling ability is necessary for the magnets used for magnetic resonance imaging, a common medical diagnostic procedure. The other common coolant is liquid nitrogen (boiling point, 77 K ), which is significantly cheaper.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neon is a component of neon lamps and signs. Passing an electric spark through a tube containing neon at low pressure generates the familiar red glow of neon. It is possible to change the color of the light by mixing argon or mercury vapor with the neon or by utilizing glass tubes of a special color.\n",
    "\n",
    "Argon was useful in the manufacture of gas-filled electric light bulbs, where its lower heat conductivity and chemical\n",
    "\n",
    "inertness made it preferable to nitrogen for inhibiting the vaporization of the tungsten filament and prolonging the life of the bulb. Fluorescent tubes commonly contain a mixture of argon and mercury vapor. Argon is the third most abundant gas in dry air.\n",
    "\n",
    "Krypton-xenon flash tubes are used to take high-speed photographs. An electric discharge through such a tube gives a very intense light that lasts only $\\frac{1}{50,000}$ of a second. Krypton forms a difluoride, $\\mathrm{KrF}_{2}$, which is thermally unstable at room temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stable compounds of xenon form when xenon reacts with fluorine. Xenon difluoride, $\\mathrm{XeF}_{2}$, forms after heating an excess of xenon gas with fluorine gas and then cooling. The material forms colorless crystals, which are stable at room temperature in a dry atmosphere. Xenon tetrafluoride, $\\mathrm{XeF}_{4}$, and xenon hexafluoride, $\\mathrm{XeF}_{6}$, are prepared in an analogous manner, with a stoichiometric amount of fluorine and an excess of fluorine, respectively. Compounds with oxygen are prepared by replacing fluorine atoms in the xenon fluorides with oxygen.\n",
    "When $\\mathrm{XeF}_{6}$ reacts with water, a solution of $\\mathrm{XeO}_{3}$ results and the xenon remains in the $6+$-oxidation state:\n",

    "### Summary \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 18.1 Periodicity\n",
    "\n",
    "This section focuses on the periodicity of the representative elements. These are the elements where the electrons are entering the $s$ and $p$ orbitals. The representative elements occur in groups 1,2 , and $12-18$. These elements are representative metals, metalloids, and nonmetals. The alkali metals (group 1) are very reactive, readily form ions with a charge of $1+$ to form ionic compounds that are usually soluble in water, and react vigorously with water to form hydrogen gas and a basic solution of the metal hydroxide. The outermost electrons of the alkaline earth metals (group 2) are more difficult to remove than the outer electron of the alkali metals, leading to the group 2 metals being less\n",
    "\n",
    "reactive than those in group 1. These elements easily form compounds in which the metals exhibit an oxidation state of $2+$. Zinc, cadmium, and mercury (group 12) commonly exhibit the group oxidation state of $2+$ (although mercury also exhibits an oxidation state of $1+$ in compounds that contain $\\mathrm{Hg}_{2}{ }^{2+}$ ). Aluminum, gallium, indium, and thallium (group 13) are easier to oxidize than is hydrogen. Aluminum, gallium, and indium occur with an oxidation state 3+ (however, thallium also commonly occurs as the $\\mathrm{Tl}^{+}$ion). Tin and lead form stable divalent cations and covalent compounds in which the metals exhibit the $4+$-oxidation state.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 18.2 Occurrence and Preparation of the Representative Metals \n",
    "\n",
    "Because of their chemical reactivity, it is necessary to produce the representative metals in their pure forms by reduction from naturally occurring compounds. Electrolysis is important in the production of sodium, potassium, and aluminum. Chemical reduction is the primary method for the isolation of magnesium, zinc, and tin. Similar procedures are important for the other representative metals.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 18.3 Structure and General Properties of the Metalloids\n",
    "\n",
    "The elements boron, silicon, germanium, arsenic, antimony, and tellurium separate the metals from the nonmetals in the periodic table. These elements, called metalloids or sometimes semimetals, exhibit properties characteristic of both metals and nonmetals. The structures of these elements are similar in many ways to those of nonmetals, but the elements are electrical semiconductors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 18.4 Structure and General Properties of the Nonmetals\n",
    "\n",
    "Nonmetals have structures that are very different from those of the metals, primarily because they have greater electronegativity and electrons that are more tightly bound to individual atoms. Most nonmetal oxides are acid anhydrides, meaning that they react with water to form acidic solutions. Molecular structures are common for most of the nonmetals, and several have multiple allotropes with varying physical properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 18.5 Occurrence, Preparation, and Compounds of Hydrogen\n",
    "\n",
    "Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe and its chemistry is truly unique. Although it has some chemical reactivity that is similar to that of the alkali metals, hydrogen has many of the same chemical properties of a nonmetal with a relatively low electronegativity. It forms ionic hydrides with active metals, covalent compounds in which it has an oxidation state of $1-$ with less electronegative elements, and covalent compounds in which it has an oxidation state of $1+$ with more electronegative nonmetals. It reacts explosively with oxygen, fluorine, and chlorine, less readily with bromine, and much less readily with iodine, sulfur, and nitrogen. Hydrogen reduces the oxides of metals with lower reduction potentials than chromium to form the metal and water. The hydrogen halides are all acidic when dissolved in water.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 18.6 Occurrence, Preparation, and Properties of Carbonates\n",
    "\n",
    "The usual method for the preparation of the carbonates of the alkali and alkaline earth metals is by reaction of an oxide or hydroxide with carbon dioxide. Other carbonates form by precipitation. Metal carbonates or hydrogen carbonates such as limestone $\\left(\\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}\\right)$, the antacid Tums $\\left(\\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}\\right)$, and baking soda $\\left(\\mathrm{NaHCO}_{3}\\right)$ are common examples. Carbonates and hydrogen carbonates decompose in the presence of acids and most decompose on heating.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 18.7 Occurrence, Preparation, and Properties of Nitrogen\n",
    "\n",
    "Nitrogen exhibits oxidation states ranging from 3- to 5+. Because of the stability of the $\\mathrm{N} \\equiv \\mathrm{N}$ triple bond, it requires a great deal of energy to make compounds from molecular nitrogen. Active metals such as the alkali metals and alkaline earth metals can reduce nitrogen to form metal nitrides. Nitrogen oxides and nitrogen hydrides are also important substances.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 18.8 Occurrence, Preparation, and Properties of Phosphorus\n",
    "\n",
    "Phosphorus (group 15) commonly exhibits oxidation states of 3- with active metals and of 3+ and 5+ with more electronegative nonmetals. The halogens and oxygen will oxidize phosphorus. The oxides are phosphorus $(\\mathrm{V})$ oxide, $\\mathrm{P}_{4} \\mathrm{O}_{10}$, and phosphorus(III) oxide, $\\mathrm{P}_{4} \\mathrm{O}_{6}$. The two common methods for preparing orthophosphoric acid, $\\mathrm{H}_{3} \\mathrm{PO}_{4}$,\n",
    "\n",
    "are either the reaction of a phosphate with sulfuric acid or the reaction of water with phosphorus(V) oxide. Orthophosphoric acid is a triprotic acid that forms three types of salts.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 18.9 Occurrence, Preparation, and Compounds of Oxygen \n",
    "\n",
    "Oxygen is one of the most reactive elements. This reactivity, coupled with its abundance, makes the chemistry of oxygen very rich and well understood.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compounds of the representative metals with oxygen exist in three categories (1) oxides, (2) peroxides and superoxides, and (3) hydroxides. Heating the corresponding hydroxides, nitrates, or carbonates is the most common method for producing oxides. Heating the metal or metal oxide in oxygen may lead to the formation of peroxides and superoxides. The soluble oxides dissolve in water to form solutions of hydroxides. Most metals oxides are base anhydrides and react with acids. The hydroxides of the representative metals react with acids in acid-base reactions to form salts and water. The hydroxides have many commercial uses.\n",
    "All nonmetals except fluorine form multiple oxides. Nearly all of the nonmetal oxides are acid anhydrides. The acidity of oxyacids requires that the hydrogen atoms bond to the oxygen atoms in the molecule rather than to the other nonmetal atom. Generally, the strength of the oxyacid increases with the number of oxygen atoms bonded to the nonmetal atom and not to a hydrogen.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 18.10 Occurrence, Preparation, and Properties of Sulfur\n",
    "\n",
    "Sulfur (group 16) reacts with almost all metals and readily forms the sulfide ion, $\\mathrm{S}^{2-}$, in which it has as oxidation state of $2-$. Sulfur reacts with most nonmetals.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 18.11 Occurrence, Preparation, and Properties of Halogens\n",
    "\n",
    "The halogens form halides with less electronegative elements. Halides of the metals vary from ionic to covalent; halides of nonmetals are covalent. Interhalogens form by the combination of two or more different halogens.\n",
    "All of the representative metals react directly with elemental halogens or with solutions of the hydrohalic acids (HF, $\\mathrm{HCl}, \\mathrm{HBr}$, and HI ) to produce representative metal halides. Other laboratory preparations involve the addition of aqueous hydrohalic acids to compounds that contain such basic anions, such as hydroxides, oxides, or carbonates.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 18.12 Occurrence, Preparation, and Properties of the Noble Gases\n",
    "\n",
    "The most significant property of the noble gases (group 18) is their inactivity. They occur in low concentrations in the atmosphere. They find uses as inert atmospheres, neon signs, and as coolants. The three heaviest noble gases react with fluorine to form fluorides. The xenon fluorides are the best characterized as the starting materials for a few other noble gas compounds.\n",
