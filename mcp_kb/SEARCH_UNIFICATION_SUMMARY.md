# Search Method Unification Summary

## Changes Made

The search functionality in `ContentTree` has been unified to reduce confusion and redundancy. Here's what was changed:

## Before (Redundant Methods)
- `search_inverse_index()` - Basic search with deprecation warning
- `search_content()` - Used InverseIndexBuilder's get_matching_nodes
- `search_with_ngrams()` - Also used InverseIndexBuilder's get_matching_nodes  
- All three methods essentially did the same thing with slight variations

## After (Unified Methods)

### 1. `search_content(query, max_results=10, use_ngrams=True)` - **MAIN METHOD**
- **Primary search method** that handles all search scenarios
- Uses `InverseIndexBuilder` with advanced n-gram scoring when `use_ngrams=True`
- Falls back to simple monogram matching when `use_ngrams=False`
- Has robust error handling with fallback to basic search
- **Recommended method for most use cases**

### 2. `enhanced_search(query, max_results=10, semantic_weight=0.6, lexical_weight=0.4)`
- Uses `InverseIndexBuilder.calculate_lexical_similarity()` for advanced scoring
- Applies weighted scoring (currently only lexical, semantic reserved for future)
- **Best for advanced relevance scoring**

### 3. `search_content_tree(query, max_results=10, use_ngrams=True)`
- Wrapper around `search_content()` that returns actual `ContentNode` objects
- **Best when you need the actual node objects, not just IDs and scores**

### 4. `search_inverse_index(query, max_results=10)` - **DEPRECATED**
- Shows deprecation warning and calls `search_content(use_ngrams=False)`
- **Should not be used in new code**

## Key Benefits

1. **Single Entry Point**: `search_content()` is now the main method with configurable behavior
2. **Reduced Confusion**: No more wondering which search method to use
3. **Better Fallback**: Robust error handling with automatic fallback to simpler methods
4. **Flexible Usage**: Can toggle between advanced n-gram scoring and simple matching
5. **Clear Deprecation**: Old methods are clearly marked as deprecated

## Usage Examples

```python
# Basic usage (recommended)
results = tree.search_content("chemistry atoms")

# Simple matching without n-grams
results = tree.search_content("chemistry atoms", use_ngrams=False)

# Get actual node objects
nodes = tree.search_content_tree("chemistry atoms")

# Advanced scoring
results = tree.enhanced_search("chemistry atoms")

# Deprecated (shows warning)
results = tree.search_inverse_index("chemistry atoms")  # Don't use this
```

## Search Index Architecture

The unified system uses:
- **InverseIndexBuilder**: Advanced n-gram indexes (monograms, bigrams, trigrams)
- **Basic inverse_index**: Simple term-to-node mapping (fallback)
- **Lexical similarity**: Weighted scoring based on n-gram matches

## Test Results

All search methods were tested successfully with queries like:
- "chemistry atoms" → Found relevant chemistry sections
- "measurements accuracy" → Found measurement and precision sections  
- "density volume" → Found related physics/chemistry content
- "scientific method" → Found methodology sections

The unified system provides consistent, reliable search functionality with appropriate fallbacks for robustness.
